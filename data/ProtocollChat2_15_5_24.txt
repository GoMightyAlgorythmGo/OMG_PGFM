[17.08.2023, 13:10:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Kognition still impaired altho less like under the medication   Felt almost like they would wipe my ability to remember or hold thoughts in mind extreamly
[17.08.2023, 13:11:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Complex
[17.08.2023, 14:29:26] Marco Luca Hefti: I dont know what i should do. On one hand i would like to go to grandparents and rebecca if she would be better off but since im quite sure the thing with me and her when small children and me being blamed after and me being told waaaay later when i already forgotten since i did not think i did something purposefully bad but more it being a sad strange part of nature - not to mention the parents reaction or later in life blockages of therapy where or the seeming scientific consensus that depression was maybe triggered by some things and my research 🔬 lightened some of the reasons why that one altho so seemingly innocent and seemingly very harmless and well ment thing could potentially activate a predisposition to depression.

Also as someone suffering with probably adhd with dystimia (a chronic mild form of depression) (or part of my seemingly chronic adhd type)  i knew she was said to be in higher education, more friends and so on. So if it was a unlucky cruel turn of nature as it so very often happens in the world we would both be victims of chance and blaming the more severe one that vowed to help when bigger, richer, stronger as a scapegoat almost in medival fashion i think definitly would not help or be moral. And actually be directly contrary to actually helping but make things worse. And stop the person that honestly was seriously planing to help, eventho he had strong problems with memory and all kinds of other things.
[17.08.2023, 14:42:49] Marco Luca Hefti: So if i believe im crazy and my clear memory and rationality i can demonstrate in every way exept the typical adhd dystimia which is not impairing my reasoning ability in that way, then i would believe the quick 2 meters black guy storry but its ridiculous to do so. While i will out of respect pretend that and to not make rolf or anyone angry or hurt even if Rececca might pretend to “forget” and heal. Altho i think its risky. Not because of this but because of the recent years and what happened that just so happens to heavily align with many very seemingly big big res flaggs i would be grossly negligent to ignore.

However i also know im in a situation where my reputation might be too vulnerable in such a szenario with all to be believed easily anyway. For that reason and my wish for non confrontational win-win by me helping as i can when i can or my longerterm plan ~35-50.
[17.08.2023, 14:49:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Stiefvater glaubt ich sei für depression von Cousine als wir Kinder waren wegen Dökterle adhd version.

Now im concerned more and more and things point in that direction based on what i experienced.

The “Medication trials” felt like chemical imprisonment/punishment however if so it would be very carefully planed or money invested.

As a rich doctor family they definitly have that money and the smarts add to that high iq   victor that told me what he “could” do if i dont keep quiet or if he felt attacked. I did not feel like i did attack so hopefully that was nothing thibgs like that have been said many times. 

Still the timing and endless coincidences made me only slightly vigilant.

I am only doing little but i feel like if i dont do anything i could be set up. Too many strange things happened and noone would listen.

But i did prepare things so they would be investigated if they did. But i have to be very careful.

This is not a “definitive” and im eriting on devices that are hacked according to windows defender and other “coincidences”

[21.08.2023, 08:35:12] Marco Luca Hefti: slightly more and more exhausted. Maybe 30 Strattera is slightly too much of a mg Dosage leading to exhaustion over weeks and months. But it is not that different from the ususal so probably not. I still feel more motivated and fresh than on many many months over the years of victor telling me/suggesting (but i am kinda dependant since he gets the perscriptions and for whatever reason my reputation seems kinda hurt from the get-go, again maybe a smear campaign i don't know off) but im staying optimistic eventho i experienced bad things the medication or my memory seems hurt a lot so i am having trouble remembering.

[22.08.2023, 09:48:23] Marco Luca Hefti: Vater hat mich angerufen und gesagt eine Polizistin hätte Ihn angerufen wegen der Datendiebstalmeldung, welche ich auf ausdrückliche Empfehlung eines Polizisten kurz vorgenommen hatte, nachdem mein Antivirus mich darüber informiert hatte das meine Email und Passwörter gestohlen wurden schon seit 2021 und vorhär / im "dark web" bei Datenpannen aufgetaucht sind. Ich habe nur nach der Empfehlung vom Experten gehandelt es war eine Sache von 30 Minuten.
[23.08.2023, 10:08:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Herr Dubach hat berichtet eine Polizistin hat angerufen wegen meinem Befinden wegen Polizei Selbstanzeige im kleinen Stiel vor 1-2 Wochen. Ich war etwas besorgt wo durchaus leichte eine leichte Anxiety und worrie jeh nach Gedanken auch die «gefühlte » Dringlichkeit erhöht haben könnte. Jetzt viel entspanter. Es war auch schlechtes timing zwischen Equasim.
[23.08.2023, 13:47:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Brain was faster 2-3 weeks ago in 30 Equasim when V. seemed to test/slighty provoke some paranoid feel.

And i felt more motivation but also a bit worrie at the same time
[24.08.2023, 19:06:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Vorher 25 min bett meditation/rest
[25.08.2023, 09:54:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Slight anxiety breath and "turned off brain" or "gelähmtes" / langsames/leeres Hirn öfters.
[25.08.2023, 12:39:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor in the last meet a [ victortreffen 22.08.2023 ] was in the shirt of a organisation for children with muscle degenerative desease and told me a storry about two small children who may recall being abused and that they are in conversation with Therapeut personel about it so i Dont have to worry. His girlfriend he sais they are back together. He confirmed that is where he went when he said "going to Lager in holyday".

Happy the girlfriend / ex / him could find back together suposidly even found V so important that she came at 3 in the moring to him as im told. 

Also discussed other things and Victor wanned to give me the dosages i was under in the last years and send it to me by the end of the week and we talked about 30 mg and the improvements but also told him about the "Selbstanzeige" where nothing really happens its just a report siting there in the system. And the "recommended to me when i asked the polic "gestolene Daten/Data breach" report from the antivirus" this one was something else and only was a short thing. But the report sits there and altough it wont be used to do anything its nice to have a record in case it ever may or may not become relevant.

Just for protocoll
[25.08.2023, 12:39:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Meditated 15 minutes
[25.08.2023, 12:42:20] Marco Luca Hefti: I am not doing as much as i would like to. The motivation is not bad but also not great so as already experienced in other dosages/ADHD im kinda doing things slugishly its almost like reuptake of dopamine might increase again slightly. Altho i Dont really feel a worsening if i had to choose i would say the trend right now is improving since 40 Equasim. Meaning that the more days pass the more motivated/awake/earlyer to bed/better more consise writing outside and less so but somethimes even in protocolls might become/be. Overall its not so much changing as consistant and its only been three days including today.

[26.08.2023, 16:55:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Left the orchidee not 10 min more like 1 h in the water by mistake, i was busy. Or slow/distracted but i think mostly because woeking memory cant keep in mind all thibgs at the same time so i might be slower/less focussed.
[27.08.2023, 09:36:58] Marco Luca Hefti: Time seems slower now that i ate breakfast and trying to do stuff. 1/6 of the day went by sleeping a bit longer (after meds 6:30) since i was forced to go to bed at ~3:00 because of gf meet.

[27.08.2023, 11:28:11] Marco Luca Hefti: struggling with motivation. Procrastinating by researching organisation/to do list strategies
ears somethimes get "druck clogged" like when you enter a tunnel. Maybe becuase when i think of "forcing myself breathing changes and then when eventually breathing the thing with the ears happens" hard to say..

Hm... well could become better i may just be a bit slower for now might be the "getting" used to more non ADHD brain idk.. the "motivated phase had some of that cognition and recall and all come back another one of those moments where cognition was there again"

In letster Zeit vorsichtiger was ich sage selbst wenn ich es für harmlos oder freundlich empfinde weil Leute zum teil so verschieden reagieren und ich nicht immer meiner Intuition betreffen sympatie auf nicht perfekter Einstellung/schwankend vertraue.
[28.08.2023, 10:04:32] Marco Luca Hefti: motivation very low
[28.08.2023, 10:05:51] Marco Luca Hefti: The slow gradual decline of the motivation i had 2-4 weeks ago has continued. Soon switching or lowering equasim to 20 i guess but for now, while i sit and try to do what i am supposed to im massively procrastinating but time is moving slowly luckely right now so i might still get things done its only around 1.3/7 parts into the day still time..

[30.08.2023, 20:00:29] Marco Luca Hefti: 40 Equasim or the being out and doing things may bring some strain and feel like slightly higer stress. Not always but now that i was in RAV and moving around a bunch i feel it a bit, then again might just be the lower motivation of 40 vs the boost at the beginning or middle of 30 that felt so much better at times (like i would not feel disconfort like now but much more «normal» exept the worries and feeling the heart rate at some points.).

So it was worse and better.

Maybe this is better after a while altho at times it feels often kinda «dry skin like »

Could be a sign of Equasim too much or strattera too high with this equasim. (Or too low if higher strattera would mean less «stimulation but intuition would say reduce strattera as long planed because maybe noradrenergic component too high. Idk probably complex gona follow Victor plans as usual altho i would like to try some stuff myself, there seem to be improvements the work attempts and more visits and chores than seemingly at many many points before and the very good social ability at isolated points of the « boost  like » phase about 2-5 weeks ago exept the sligt worries at that time. Which i think where trivial in effect i wrote more and made 1 visit to the Police but that was actually (i was told twice) not going to do much.

I guess since the meds where runing low at 14:30 it was a bad moment meds wise.

The report stolen account data was a quick thing of 30 min and it was suggested by a P. on the phone when i asked.

Other than that there was pretty much nothing than being a human that did more chores, work and visited and talked to people i had not visited in a while altho i wanted to.

(Victor hat mir kürzlich gesagt ich könne ihm wenn es «dringende medikationsbezoge Fragen oder wichtiges gäbe anrufen » obwohl das RAV dringend ist bin ich nicht sicher ob es wichtig genug ist.
[31.08.2023, 21:43:13] Marco Luca Hefti: Ich werde morgen in dem fall auf 20mg Equasim reduzieren (victor hat 40 und 20 gesagt also sollte das mehr als okay sein nur etwas sorgen/risiko das ich dann kurzfristig wenniger Leistibgsfähig sein könnte da mein köper sich eventuell an die 40 angepasst hat.

Nun ja tiefer ist vermutlich « sicherer » / lieber gesehen.
Erhöhen kann man auf Victors Empfehlung später immernoch wenn er sich meldet. 📝💪
[31.08.2023, 23:00:49] Marco Luca Hefti: The RAV stuff is super urgent i guess and i Dont want to seem like i cant do it i have to cant go back to "medication lay on floor" situation, but i also have to really check the motorcycle situation and i really have to check the Hausarzt stuff or whatever might be urgent on the to do list i forget often.

I guess it might be implied that he would follow and leave the WG-apartment for that reason potentially, but he did not really say that so i guess i just take it as a possibility depending what Thomasz tells me is decided internally in the company.
[01.09.2023, 09:19:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Quick note about relationship:
-At some points when i would make shorter good morning or good night texts my lover would get angry and curse and withhold sex and be really upset, but recently she does not seem to mind short messages, maybe she is just busy i guess, or maybe her mood shiftet, or maybe she wanned more concise but still "somehow passionate or meaningful" texts whatever that means to her at any moment. Her taste does seem to change quite dramatically tho somethimes, i guess it might be medication related or also be influenced how i "come across" to hear outside of that.
[01.09.2023, 11:49:33] Marco Luca Hefti: ℹ Seit heute reduziert von 40 auf 20 Equasim (wie von Victor angewiesen (allerdings ohne konkretes Datum wann ich das soll, und ist momentan nicht erreichbar)).
‎[01.09.2023, 13:50:52] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[01.09.2023, 17:48:01] Marco Luca Hefti: Brain worse today but hard to feel somethimes with the meds that somethimes throw up balance for a bit or decrease sensitivity to some things while increasing other stuff.

Mostly a wating game probably dopamine baseline lower now with reduction for a while
[01.09.2023, 17:55:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Brain seems a bit slow to realize or think of things almost like a bit lazy but its hard to notice just sublte executive functions and during the day by small signs (variable schwankend) and because i know more or less feom exp what i might be able to expect from 40 -> 20
[01.09.2023, 18:02:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Or maybe 20 is too low but definitly nothing usual going from higer dosage to lower to have smth like that here
[01.09.2023, 18:22:00] Marco Luca Hefti: New hypothesis i just came up with (or remembered from way back):

Adhd too little mistake in dopamine related neural networks -> too litte decomposition/reduction of pathways leading to stop on current available free ressources/pathways = low working memory 

What do the drugs do? Errors in system = increase failure % -> increase breaking down (better word than decomposition) of dopa and freeing uo available neurons/monoamine availability.

Also increased reuptake because trying to do many withs with little free ressource

[02.09.2023, 08:00:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Feeling a bit "psychologically" exhausted from doing chores/paperwork, uncomfortable things i have to force myself and boring things and probably from the drop in Equasim to 20 from 40 since yesterday. But will probably get better over time. Eyes seem a bit in "sleep mode". 'Could use coffee' is the feel.
[02.09.2023, 08:01:24] Marco Luca Hefti: not all too much. might be temporary. In fact i expected smth like that and it to get better with time on 20 Eq.
[02.09.2023, 09:04:03] Marco Luca Hefti: When i have motivation i often work more and game/leisure less, but after a while when its still too low i start giving up in some way stopping to force myself so much since it seems kinda pointless and then i game way more again and try to work on longterm solutions again. So just because i do a lot does not mean it has nothing to do with me pushing my willpower reserves.

But i generally game out of a lack of other drive/enjoyment of more useful things which are totally possible and i experienced lots and other people experence most/all of the time on different baselines.
[02.09.2023, 09:04:34] Marco Luca Hefti: ADHD is just the bottom of a spectrum in some respect, thats where the medication comes in. But its not so simple.

Since i recently got some viruses ill just leave it does not impede on my other stuff i do anyway. Also some protection history seems to have changed/disappeared i guess just disappears after a while or bug idk. Not so important anyway i guess.
[02.09.2023, 09:22:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Gotta manage time today so i get things done and balance stuff. So i Dont get burned out even tho i could do "MUCH" more if i had the right meds/brain would not refuse to use the abilitys it definitly has based on variable performance i know they are there. 
ADHD thing is really annoying. :S
[02.09.2023, 09:22:50] Marco Luca Hefti: when im "schlapp" i write more lazily but it was way worse and better before so as long as "I" understand it.
[02.09.2023, 10:05:26] Marco Luca Hefti: -V.M. peer should already know - told and has link to my WhatsApp Med Protokoll log

[02.09.2023, 20:05:43] Marco Luca Hefti: Meditated 30 min

Low drive
[02.09.2023, 20:09:55] Marco Luca Hefti: Both ears slightly red
[03.09.2023, 06:39:08] Marco Luca Hefti: -I hope Victor is not letting the strattera perscription run out like last time and blame it on apparant « paranoia » when im absolutely normal, exept the small thing over a month ago and that was not even that just a but ramped up.

Now im on 30 Strattera and 20 Equasim since many days and im totally normal if anything, im normal-low Elan not elevated.

Victor did not respond so far. I did exactly what he told me and am perfectly amendable to normal communication.

But i worry people might decide things behind my back again like it apparantly happen last time and then my memory will crush and i will barely be able to remember.
[03.09.2023, 07:17:11] Marco Luca Hefti: I sleept a bit late yesterday because i wanned to go to bed slightly « early » as i missed the opportunit repeatedly in the past weeks where i would go to bed slightly later as is usually the case when im having a biz truble getting to sleep since im a child as is common in adhd.

Yesterday then i forgot dinner (well also thought it might be good to shift the balance of calories to the beginning of the day) 

And i forgot that it makes you wakeful if you skip food somethimes.

So i was kinda not sleeping then realized it and ate a bit and then went to sleep at like 00:00 and if my hon comes today (she insists on coming very late like most of the time)
Then i might be a wrack on money when i would have to argue to the « Apotheke » about the strattera since Victor seems to let the perscriptions run out then tells me he sent them again and it just seems not very sure at any point that they will be there and if i suddenly skipp am forced to stopp the strattera to 0mg then i might forget everything again and be barely able to talk in combination with low stimulants and get fat and depressed again.
[03.09.2023, 07:23:23] Marco Luca Hefti: I think that happened before. If i was speculating i could say it is on purpose but obviously im not saying that but im able to think along « unlikely possibility’s » based on patterns over the years which i tried to express to multible professionalls who im not sure take me seriously. Especially since when im on the wrong meds or when it goes up and down all the time depending on med its hard to remember and be nicely dressed and « fully perfectly appearing eloquent »

But all is fine.

Im low drive and concentration again like most of the years average but still slightly better so i hope to get some applications done and hope dad finally tells me about the doctor so i can finally send the email.

I could call more or do more but then i might seem « erratic » or play into the stereotype of «psychotic » which i am definitly not and if i am i would be easily amendable to reason and normal discourse and conversation.

Im litterally more the opposite of « too entusjastic/confident »
[03.09.2023, 07:25:22] Marco Luca Hefti: Anyway… just in case the chat loggs if i have to show them in case there is a legal dispute or attempts to argue im not totally rational. 


I am and i followed Victor M. / Psychiatrists directives 100% but some is by discussion and i hope i could argue that.
[03.09.2023, 07:28:31] Marco Luca Hefti: All good. Today i guess i also game more since at some point it was argued « he gamed less so that is a sign of smth bad, when obviously i only game if i have no motivation and discomfort to do more useful things, i could always enjoy some gaming when im motivated to work, the question is just why when i enjoy or « can » focus should i instead game.

But i get the balance argument but im not a gamer at heart im forced by mental health to be since im stuck home/low drive/discomfort at effort a lot when im in bad shape mentally.

But im always rational in the sense that i can explain everything i do and say.
[03.09.2023, 07:29:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Anyway…. Food then some game and then hopefully some work eventho i sleept short… 🙁

[03.09.2023, 13:26:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Usually i write way more exited and more to Gracie but i guess as long as she is not angry about less like in the past im happy with it. 🎉😊
[03.09.2023, 13:51:08] Marco Luca Hefti: Are days going by less quick because im doing less chores or going outside to do things like with 30 Equasim? Maybe, some days felt after the days where over some of the time, but not always.

Im currently making plans how to work out the responibilitys that are most urgent before the early evening. gf
[03.09.2023, 14:30:46] Marco Luca Hefti: gastrointestinal motility increased after some food and towards the middle of the day beetween the two 8 hour equasim 20 windows ~14:20. Now 2. 20 Equasim this is day three since 20 Equasim.
[04.09.2023, 10:10:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Sleept 4-5 hours because Gracie stayed until ~1:00 (she had to insist)

spent until 9:30 breakfast, shaving, waking up, music, raiser broken needs to be given in for "guarantee" etc.

Now working on RAV going to bring the signed Dokuments, still waiting on Dad/company to send the "Arbeitszeugnis" he sent a email saying "here is the corrected "Arbeitszeugnis" but the "Arbeitsvertrag" was included not the "Arbeitszeugnis" - I already notified him.
[04.09.2023, 10:38:46] Marco Luca Hefti: 2. try to call Herr Ochoa RAV this time occupied and instantly disconnected
[04.09.2023, 10:47:29] Marco Luca Hefti: 3
4. time i called and the call dropped 35-40 seconds after ringing
[04.09.2023, 11:52:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Tryed to reach Herr Ochoa RAV again but was so far not able to still.

~6-7 times so far
[04.09.2023, 11:52:26] Marco Luca Hefti: But written correspondance earlier
[04.09.2023, 14:18:33] Marco Luca Hefti: RAV Tasks: Getting your employment and termination documents in order is the first priority.

Copy Quick: For your document copying and signing needs.

Media Markt: Deal with the refund or repair.

Shopping: Pick up new razor blades for shaving.

Clothes: Iron your clothes for the week ahead.

Dinner: Prepare an amazing dinner to wrap up the day productively.

Rest: A good night's sleep is key for high performance the next day, so going to bed early is a good move.

Some Free Time: Always important to balance out work with leisure, even if it's a brief period of relaxation.

Optional: Is there any ongoing project or learning you want to dip into during your free time? Given your interest in various subjects and skills, even a short burst of productive learning can be rewarding.
-review to do list
[04.09.2023, 16:07:43] Marco Luca Hefti: Neighbour right in middle Apartment (rarely see) was waiting in the hallway on phone. I was about to go locked the door and greeted « Grüezi » my tone of voice was slighty too strong/off as i intended because meds where about to kick in but bot yet.

Looked at me said nothing and went inside his Apartment.

Looked similar to Ruben with the blak hair skinny tall like Ruben who once lifed in the WG and used to borrow my iphone charging cable a lot in the end. Biology 🧫 stemcells something like production/experiment on eye cells among other stuff was doing masters. Lots of spanish people (also Asier) seem to work/study here.

This next part is risking to be interpreted in a bad way risking my medication which would be better and give more controll to 3. person Victor and further damage my reputation but im damned if i do and damned if i dont. If i dont there is no record and if i do it is suposidly « delusional » anyway this chat is totally private and only when im partially correct would it be read anyway i did not give anyone a link to read this particular chat (if i did not make a mistake or smth). It is basically just as a very unlikely protocoll «in case»
some of that very unlikely stuff is true. But writing something that is unlikely to benefit anyone is unlikely to be useful should not hurt anyway - recall:
 
R once got angry at me/seemed to explode a bit/lose  control for a second while i was holdig small onion knife and a small cuding board. Then after i put the stuff in the fride to cook later since Ruben was angry and i did not really know why just that he seemed angry for a few days kinda passive agressive or passive grudging/quiet He took big knife 🔪 and say smth like dont do dont say X anymore refering to a event from earlier, i was kinda confused but not too much, i written in the logs about the Dosage that seemed to kinda  have me in « fight of flight even when i was totally cool and collected » inside
« i think he refered to when i said hello and he used to not say anything and i said «I said hello? » as threatening to his « pride » or smth or was passive angry because he maybe felt i was not talking much because i dont like him as suposed to the dosage/ whatever laying flat my social drive/other issues making it hard to keep track (altho i think i was always more or less okay on « chores and in the end i mostly did more when people move out but not always). And they also did not want to do lists of who did how much, probably because it seemed stupid to write it down ✍️ by a « mark » on a papaper but i woule have kinda liked that scaffolding but for them probably 5 seconds of wasted time - very rarely people also resist plans when they are low on  housetasks or do them less because they use them less and it would look bad on a List without context. I did not really feel that was the case there (…the ladder potentially.. but not the former).
Oh and Ruben at some points said he was feeling depressed mayve around his foot injury but i dont quite know how much but i noted it probably on some occasion in the V_Chat logs so it was know to my peer.

well who knows. Somethings think …. He maybe had to (if he would be talking to people) about it would slightly distort the storry to make him look less negative like i observed some people do over my life - i dont blame him or have any negative feelibgs. If u dont understand my inner life while the horrendus meds/adhd/depri goes through me lack of smile/unhappy mannerisms can easily be taken personally especially if people are under pressure of a tought job and lose all friends when conibg to a new country.

… to save face when telling other people about it and i wrote it in Protocol chat so if Victor saw it and the «i would go theought the past or people with lists and whatever (botion/excell or whatever) if they threthened/draged down my reputation » as exessive « get back » seemingly in a way to say « dont fuck with me, since i was not doing that anyway seemed more strange and a calculated thibg to say it » 

Im writing this in case that extremly u likely scenario of
(seemed quite erradic eventho he was initiating it) and i think he mistuk the «fight of flight » overactive response in tone of voice and facial experessions together with loss of social drive temporarily as some sort of challenge or agressive behaviour.

It is a long text and will likely never be used for anything. So i was in public transport and more journaling and writing a bit… said to be healthy even extremely unprobable things. Because of that (and the sun) did i not put much effort into formattig etc…

[05.09.2023, 10:59:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Protocol/journal as always:
The Person at the Pharmacy considered the Strattera long since although there was a perscription for it of the recent months there again was no perscription (it seems to always be late. Not at all the typical thing of Victor he can be super punctual and timely. There where regular perscriptions for multible things over years. * ->
The perscription was for the usual, and only 30mg Atomoxetine and im going to that pharmacy for 4 years or longer (since i life here and work under Victor/UPK supervision. I like them although some people seem to be quite strongly professional when dealing with me, im also feeling good to know that they keep an eye on everything and are themselfes educated professionals (at least the leading Doctor/etc of the Pharmacy.) Anyway... 
-now CV and text etc, and also 
-some short leisure 
after sending the CV for balance again.



(*Although there might have been some issues with UPK where im switched to Dr Dold Joshua (or Josua) soon/already. A  very sympatic Chef Arzt that was working with psychotic patients and also ADHD patients in the other UPK location. I meet him only once (maybe twice) but talked to him 2-7 times on the phone. He seemed smart and although according to V. suffering from Bipolar in my own estimation a brilliant Psychiatrist/Doctor. (There are phases where he has some temporary change in personality or ability to work according to Victor, honestly that only slightly adds to my feelings of symphaty...))

[06.09.2023, 08:55:22] Marco Luca Hefti: After 4 Years of following Victor Management s treatment Regimen last meeting around 2 weeks ago he said "i seem finally ready to be given the dosages/medication Data taken over the years, he will send it to me until the end of the weekend or latest end of the following week. I had asked him over the years many times where he somethimes said yes but then did not do it for reasons (cant remember the details right now). Fast forward, it has been two weeks and i again have not received any information about dosages or anything promised. Somethimes it seemes that i get promises when its already clear that the excuse to not do it is in reserve just to "appear" like i was about to get more controll/overwie/information about plans/treatments just to then be after the fact be declined and it being blamed on me. 'well i was about to but then you did X so im sorry but i have to save myself the effort/work/again as you probably expected wont receive what ur been promised'"

Now is this the case for sure? No. But since this seems to be not the first time by any strech of the imagination, eventho it is hard (but not impossible with enought time/motivation/focus) to remeber the last 4 years (becuase of the medication sideffects/up and down/unknown factor maybe).

But again this is just a protocol in case of the "psychopathic get back at me" hypothesis since the fight -> big 'help' -> 4 years later and somehow some signs of reputation damage (paypall blocked me unexplained, victor once told me police was investigating something related to minor age smth, medications seem to be handed out like im a heavy criminal or something) But im sure its all just imagination and all my fault and im totally overworring becuase im so unreasonable.

Hopefully. I guess im having a massive amount of humility because im not sure anyone else would stay this humble and not reach conclusions (premature or not)

I hope smart people (if the investigation things are true) work on this and 167iq and endless determinism for selfpercervation is not too handle for our justice systems. Or if its something benine like some reports and causion but nothing serious then being introspektive, nouanced and knowledable enought.
[06.09.2023, 08:55:59] Marco Luca Hefti: -Quick protocol now to the daily plan.

But im just taking people at there word tenitively. Sertainly seems very intelligent and collected like i rarely seen a person.

[06.09.2023, 10:24:30] Marco Luca Hefti: mail dad and such. planed a bit. Now gym then pharmacy then jobs website registration short leisure + visit family Planing and then to do list. Im quite slow at working sitll but im doing more stuff than ever before. Working would probably be easyer since i would be forced but it might burn me out. The ability is there it just burns out without the emotional part that would go with it/EF functions and the non boredom/burnout psychically that normaly goes along with those things and some kind of relaxation as well more than now.
[06.09.2023, 10:24:36] Marco Luca Hefti: so gym first
[06.09.2023, 11:50:21] Marco Luca Hefti: More yawhning
[06.09.2023, 11:55:23] Marco Luca Hefti: (Rare but love it): think and then e small emotion depending what it is, if its a strange thing maybe a “oh no 😅” not laught but “glucksen” basically a small shadow of findibg something comical. I think because stimulant drop its like kinda more uninhibited every person would kinda be a but like that its more like idk…

Super hard to notice but i note it just in case.

20 Equasim = less “serious” or “unreactive” but also somewhat less in some other way.

I think protocoll text might also have less effort behind them maybe because more discomfort baseline again and typing = slight discomfort some if the time

Neighbour is kinda sympatic i like him somehow eventho did not say hi

Sympathy is strange somethimes and somethimes wrong other times correct. But biology can be unfait eith sympathy
[06.09.2023, 17:42:48] Marco Luca Hefti: As if i sneeze i very minimally laught slighty.

But less forced than sneze more like i would not say its like mildy drunk id say its more „you think X“ then the impulse to smile comes (happened like ~1-5 times today could also just be the feeling without much typical laught mannerisms like rythmicly pushing out air while the „Zwärchfell“ / Diafram is minimally contracting roughly.

Nothing overly new that happened many times. I think it is associated with higher inhibition/stimulant and then lower / or maybe a change in being „less inhibited“ from a higher baseline before 🤷‍♂️

Its not much at all. In fact i could ~easily supress it.
[06.09.2023, 18:33:15] Marco Luca Hefti: -„It’s possible that the lower dosage of Equasim is affecting your ability to focus and manage stress, especially if you’re tackling tasks that you find particularly challenging or anxiety-inducing.“

Anxiety more as a mild constant background state with some pressure on chest… heartrate ~85 currently. But average probably lower maybe 60 or maybe 60 resting when sleeping
[06.09.2023, 20:13:05] Marco Luca Hefti: I might stay anxiety/ADHD cant argue with dad over the Arbeitszeugnis thing. But uhm im informing myself about it -> to do list. As i wrote in main protocol, some reductions in a few things and increased discomfort when doing useful things/exerting effort. Probably related to the drop in Euqasim and then consisnantly staying there over multible days. But it could be a bunch of things. The detailed explanation is in the "Marco Protokoll 15.08.2022" chat at 20:10
[06.09.2023, 21:34:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe drank blaktea containing thing just n10 min ago…
[07.09.2023, 08:56:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Also random things like walls, people, Landscapes, anything is quite random somethimes more to get the discomfort distracted i guess 🤷‍♂️
[07.09.2023, 09:03:46] Marco Luca Hefti: *Paper-Note transfer* may be scuffled: 
Herr Fischili or Fischli glaub vor paar Wuche am Telefon ka betreffen „stolen Account Data“

Paps was maybe ~ in Detroit
[07.09.2023, 11:28:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Still kida slow like often. 3-5 weeks ago i was at some points kidna faster with chores but its hard to say. I think in some way the hole med thing might be suboptimal no matter where the stimulants would go because of 30 Strattera. But not sure. Ability to remember also not the best like in the last 4 years maybe before too (but with massively notable exeptions where memory and brain are absolutely functional. Not sure why they decide to be dormant most of the time.
[07.09.2023, 15:26:54] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor seemed to for weeks/months before 4 weeks ago the small "worrie" phase happened for some of the time kinda like anxiety whith heartrate and worrie / memories preceeding it and kinda dampen when i could make a small report (i went in a suboptimal time) but i also got a lot of Pflichten and productive things done that time and got out of my "rut/hole of low drive more and more" at that time so to say. So it was a two sided coin. Way less discomfort at focusing and doing housework and feeling like i can apply for a more stringent and not so "mental health friendly" job and so on. Kinda "test" things in the way that he would say or act strange /crazy but i guess it is explained by "acting like something is very off to provoce and check for some paranoia or something"

Like the last meet he was saying "who told you Dubach or Dad?" in a overexaggerated way and when asked what he ment he just ignored the question like so often. I hope i protocolled most of it eventho often i was low drive but ja. Just for protocol... I have not felt my pulse in weeks now it was only a limited time and within that only a minority of the time obviously. And nothing new but this time it was more related to something accruing over the years and a slight part medication exaggerated worrie on top. But ja. And the report about the stolen account/password data was "recommended" to me by a police worker on the phone and i did it while doing other stuff 20-30 minutes.

Also the 1. thing i just wanned to report the thing from the past not anything more i said that. Obviously i gave some worries but mentioned clearly and repeatedly that they are only hypotheticals and not proven or things i was wanning to make a "Anzeige" or anything but it would be nice to have them mentioned as a side in the "small" report about the other thing that 99% happened way back. 8-13 years old. Ja. I often am slightly concerned that when i make a report or talk to people that the report does not really reflect totally precisely what i said but a interpretation somethimes outright misinterpretation. But that is rare since usually when i asked to get a copy of the report for my archive i was not given one. So idk. So all good. Its "just to be save" contingency planning a bit like a insurance proportional to the evidence and not more. I think other people would do more. But i also do not have that much motivation/drive and lot of discomfort when doing effortful things and a 'sort of' ADHD handy-cap as to variable executive functions exept randomly some of the time to different degrees of brilliance/restoration like when in a seeming emergency situation.
[07.09.2023, 15:35:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Predictable day again. Since the reduction to 20mg Equasim (as told by Victor  [You can test 20 or 40 or both]) the drive/work output kinda droped after i did push myself ~2 days ago. Yesterday and today have been more a return to before with still more drive but it is approching previous levels and more games/unimportant things or nothing much again maybe selfeducation by low effort YouTube video lectures or so also more non educational stuff. I have done something til 11:00 ~~ but ja... like always my life slowly withers away without me being able to do what i want or should. Would be better for everyone. Taxpayer, society, people around me, me.

I wanned to visit people but im honestly a bit low drive.... i still should force myself but people Dont want low drive Marco that is also a thing... i think strattera has to be lowered i think it interferes with Equasim but that is just a hypothesis i had for a few years and im in the process of testing by following instructions and waiting for other people to green light everything in there speed and what they think is the right timing. I can only go max speed there.
[07.09.2023, 18:37:20] Marco Luca Hefti: I have been asked for help or direction more in the last 1 month than maybe in the other 6 months or longer. I dont mind.

The guy at the pharmacy speaking german asking for Drachenweg or smth strasse 24 Coop and said he had no internet and i googled it for him. That and the person when coning from the gym it seems that since 20 Equasim im responding a bit less patient to requests maybe because more disconfort or maybe because time moves a bit faster? Idk
[07.09.2023, 19:05:03] Marco Luca Hefti: -The roommate Asier seemed to have only collected all plastic 1 time and broght it to the trash place (he found out later there is no such place and had to throw it somewhere/regular i guess) but did not do it since then. Maybe he is concerned about plastic polution or something environmental. Asier. 

-Thomasz came when i had opened my bank account mail, we had some small talk short i seemed to not be overly unsympatic. I told him its not a bad time to cook something together in the next 4 days but also not a great time. Showed him the notice i put to the WG bord about construction work at spesific dates. Pretty short. Will keep an eye on social abilityes. He seemed to smile and be quite responsive. My mood/voice sounded kinda "oh man... pesimistic" at some small points which could reflect the selfreported apparent slight decrease in lower drive/entusiyasm.

-I am starting to think that the last two days could have been worse becuase of the coffeine eventho it was very small amounts. And eventho i sleept pretty consistantly, a fair normal amount and went to bed slightly earlyer. Getting to sleep felt less comfortable than on 30 and 40 but that makes total sense. Not much change.
[07.09.2023, 19:07:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Im feeling better/good. Maybe because by mistake i drank some low dosage black tea juce mix. it should not be more than 3mg coffeine tho since the hole 50cl have about 13 according to B. A.I., I also ate a "légere coffe yogurt" (halv of it). maybe subcontious crave for stimulation might be temporary.
[07.09.2023, 19:12:09] Marco Luca Hefti: I feel like deja vu with Reto and his meds. But idk... im confusing Reto and Flurin and maybe just on and off them. Deja Vu feelings increased in the last 1 month.
[07.09.2023, 19:12:16] Marco Luca Hefti: not much but a bit
[07.09.2023, 19:12:27] Marco Luca Hefti: or memory in general

-Slightly-medium increased flatulence today.

-Mild gastrointestinal motility is gone and at normal levels again now.
[07.09.2023, 20:13:06] Marco Luca Hefti: i remembered to check the morcycle if its at dad and if not the other place, i forget things if i Dont check the to do list
[07.09.2023, 20:34:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Just for protocol: I would not sign off on the assessment in the "R. P. chat" at 19:10. I believe those are just normal ones for pain. :)
[07.09.2023, 21:53:33] Marco Luca Hefti: -Schnuggel Paps call for motorcycle legal Advice/Info denn go wandere/gschäftliches.

-He said that the motorcycle is not at all urgent and asked what he would do he confirmed that applying for a job would be the most important thing. I agree with that and altho the initial boost of motiation seems to fade maybe more with 20 Equasim (eventho it is too early to tell with only 7 days).

-So tomorrow job website and visiting with family meet planning for weekend.

-I said many times that under certain meds or without meds i seem to forget things and when i recently remembered i got a bit paniked but i was behaving very calm for all the context that is too long to remember and say but most shoudl be in the logs if they are perfeclty existant and non altered since 2018 :) (the beginning is a bit incoherant but from the last 2 years when i was not going throught medication dosages that where (temporarily heavily negatively affecting my cognitive abilitys like recall, E.F. and such) and the police report was not a big deal when listened to me calmly. Also anything that is bad is taken out of context i did not do or say anything concerning when the fulll context was concidered anythng seriously concerning in my estimation celarly is a attempt by person X to take smth out of context when it is extreame. That  would hypothetically be V. but again only if it is totally extreme like usually in philosophy with him we talked about things and i "clarfied" crazy statements after for fun. You could easily leave out the second part or ask for repetition or sertain thigns to be said. But its all good and this message is 100% private and noone can see it. 😌😊 And if so then it would serve its calm rational communication. If not it would not matter. :)
[07.09.2023, 21:55:37] Marco Luca Hefti: -and looking throught job descriptions to get one as fast as possible.

-finishing to review the to do list. I hope drive is better since it was better today only int he evening. the middle of the day was not the best.

-Im not "normal" im still under suboptimal medications and whatever ADHD thingy

im 100% extreamly easily able to argue and debatte anything and justify any action given enougth time easily
[08.09.2023, 02:43:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Where is my melatonin? Its 2:45 :(
[08.09.2023, 08:53:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Some guy claimed to invite to Bay Area AGI Startup. Said good stuff discord. Seems to have the typical arrogance and stereotypic view how talent looks and talks thought not overly sympatic. Too little confidence to join startups while under mental health, eventho i could do a looooooooot. May just be trolling like the other person but that one had a company and a discord which had multible LM bots and was very sophisticated so Dont really think so.... who knows. Cant do much in my current circumstance if i Dont get the right person i vibe with or fix my ADHD problems.

-Gym soon
[08.09.2023, 08:53:38] Marco Luca Hefti: guy = human of any gender
‎[08.09.2023, 13:06:14] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[08.09.2023, 13:53:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Not sure at all that productivity did not tank because of 20 Equasim it could also be the Strattera that is the problem no matter what i did with the stimulants. Id be very interessted in 20-25 to see if equasim really is worse without some unexplained shenanigans of meds first from V. 

Or 0 Strattera and compare equasim and/or 0 strattera and the common guanfacine equasim combination. Obviously im talking equasim not because i know its better than elvanse/lamp but because i can compare it better since i had it now.
[08.09.2023, 14:42:04] Marco Luca Hefti: As predicted the little motivation reduced further and the last 3 days where really low. But tomorrow is a iprovement.
[08.09.2023, 16:02:06] Marco Luca Hefti: -im on the walking band in the Gym and felt like doing one of those moonshot texts where i just write whatever comes to mind and get my deepest even remote maybe untealitic or super low % stuff down to digital paper.

[Contingency text to be skipped because 0.000000001% probability but its nice to write once in a while especially based on my lifes and especially last 5 years of experience: Recommend to skip]

Seeminly young  rarely see gym guy greets me about with as much entusiasm if im a convicted criminal or caused him to have to travel further. 😅 (Nothing too unusual im also not very entusjastic and great him like a person that might reach premature false conclusions and judge by appearances or just a normal dude. Which basically means nothing too unusual. 🤷‍♂️) Seems legit. 

Contingency 

Told Victor when he would get the state to enought stuff and they would be in „too deep“ then they would probably even „try to find smth“ to cover there asses for causing damage and not to have to justify all thr damage to reputation, time, opportuniycost.

Its fine since it also has its upsides like being more save if people with halv a brain are on the case altho i told V that if he got the right impulsive triggerhappy/vengencehubgry person they probably wont look very closely.

Just remember teen = 18+ category recogniced wordwide when it comes witho porn sites and if you would stop wasting time with me and look into the people with motives or the mistakes maybe like not using enought indirect people like going theought my daily journal and then indirectly contacting or somehow making peope report or act on suspition without always the same person having to make reports which would be suspitious.

Also noone ever talks to me. And that is 1 easy way to only have leads in 1 dead direction. And when your selfinteresst then is put against your willingness to not be arbitray counterproductive and fear to not have the stress and troubles with gross negligence changes then its not very good to be on the opposite end of those misaligned interest.

But its interessting to not do the wrong thing and give your careers a boost by proving ue not easily manipulated and in need of restructuring but more in need of the storrie of people not easily outwitted and solving hard stuff against the odds.

Than be a 3. world police that takes easy routes manufactures evidence and goes by % of what it immediately obviously might seem like.

It would litterally not only weeken you but the things you tried to accomplish.

If im convicted of anything other than bagatellen and stuff you find everywhere and much more with mental health then you know ur system is a 🧀 and innocent people will weaken ur case because who wants to give more freedoms to that.

There are 100 more things a really witty high iq people or group could do exploiting every blindspot in zr understanding and every bias, crack and imbalance which are plenty to be found everywhere like throught history.

Anyway since there is nothing  and my contact ingency planing for nothing this text wont be read.
If it does im partially right or im behind (which would not be hard since i had my logs shared for years so this is very well known if someone where contrary to there claims so obsessed as to read everything or notice such texts in a sea or endless daily journals by coincidence. 

The rape thing allows to ignore privacy and get all invo.
The paranoid thing allows for attempts at writing logs like this to be justification for chemical things that fuck me up since im not and the fact that i have complex ideas i can easily explain with mainstream science, argumentatively or you did not read precicely and took a contingency hypothesis as certainty (or u got feed the perfect mix of our of context, halvtruthes, manufactured, misrepresented stuff… Anyway lets see how far trust in institutions gets me. :)
[08.09.2023, 17:23:29] Marco Luca Hefti: -Training was as expected good weights but did feel mild-moderately bad

-the discomfort/adhd is slighty draining me every time i go gym, its the opposite of the training with 40 Eq where i wanned to go again but wheights where seeminlgy temporarily low but hard to say.

 -nothing unusual/unexpected compared to the last years of testing. So 30 + 40 where temporarily better (30 minght have been longer but seemed also to verly sliglthy decrease over time probably strattera slighty too much but very hard to say of the cuff.)
[08.09.2023, 17:28:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Still on 20 Equasim and 30 Strattera for the past 7-8 days. :)
‎[08.09.2023, 17:32:13] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[08.09.2023, 17:33:46] Marco Luca Hefti: Now shower. I called Moms Friend about tmr and prepared some texts. I was thinking and writing a bit. But most time spend on Treadmill almost 1 hour at ~ 6 speed with sprint and run at the end.
[08.09.2023, 17:34:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Okay/good mood. Not great but not bad :)

Appreachate principled people and my efforts to go to the gym.
[08.09.2023, 17:44:15] Marco Luca Hefti: A mix of „meh“/average/„not so bad/could be worse/some discomfort/super small amount of „nautious from drinking a bit too much water“/more appreachative/a tiny bit more „save“ (not like i felt especially unsave im taking things quite collected. And i tend to be calm in chaotic or urgend moments so to say. ☺️

Just want to be a bit faster with searching a job now that i just ended the last employment but i appreachate my gf, ch, world, people.
I really love people somethimes. Guess that is the social part of me. In my world every person has the potential for good or a place.

Protocol about mood: over ^^
[09.09.2023, 10:25:06] Marco Luca Hefti: -Beine schlafen ab und zu ein manchmal lange in einer position wo abgequeätscht und evt wegen kurzen hosen äng. Nicht sicher (~2-3 mal an gewissen tagen evt, etwas mehr als vorhär einfach würde ich sagen)
[09.09.2023, 11:59:14] Marco Luca Hefti: -doing tasks does not increase my motivation at all. In fact it diminishes and exhausts it. When meds are right it would be more like a "boost" to motivation. I had that before but not anymore. Maybe on 20-25 strattera somewhere....
[09.09.2023, 12:00:58] Marco Luca Hefti: But im not the one dictating, i have to follow what im told and can only ask for things when its allowed and often withing predefined boundarys. Also i cant/have little success at getting perscriptions myself so im forced and abhängig from other people. Although personally i think that was a mistake and it adds to my suspition of bad reports beign filed behind my back without letting me know about it or saying anything.
[09.09.2023, 12:06:59] Marco Luca Hefti: -But its been like that for the last years maybe since Fachhochschule since i wrote stuff in Group Chat maybe some person was trying to report me to get back at me with any litte thing. But im confused since i was always and tried to be as helpful as possible who cares. All great. Nice sunny day going to visit family later now writing for leisure since im super bored, and discomfort when boredom is strongest (breath anxiety) increases. But it is likely temporary and will get better once im used to the low drive ADHD state since it has not been long. But maybe the dosaging is just off which is very likely. This is nothing new i expereinced this for many months and weeks its as common as sand on the beach. I cant do anything i get prescriptions and all i can do is take them or not take them (and feel terrible eather way or "test" to hopefully find the right medication "Einstellung" eventually.

Contingency text:
-I wonder if you constantly change medications at the right time you can keep someone in the perfect state of sideffects and medications that Dont work and if you then report any minor thing you might be able to get enought dirt so noone believes you anymore that way cutting the person off more and making them even more dependant on yourself. But of course noone would ever  do that becuase it would be unlikely and bad. (Also you can blame the victim is crazy/reckless/dumb when i have been perfectly following every thing to the T for 4 years.)
[09.09.2023, 12:44:57] Marco Luca Hefti: -chronic dystimia seems to increase to higher levels again after the recent periods of 30 Eq and 40 Eq and maybe best during the small boost phase 3-5 weeks ago where relaxed motivated phases of ease of doing chores and work where fluctuating with bad phases of slightly increased worrie and feeling my pulse but those seemed to be no big deal. It is like no fun and discomfort and bored but less strong but chronic. Also the reduced cognitive/brain/psychological abilitys like lower drive or reluctance or feeling lazy and being more vulnerable to discomfort or bad working memory or slow memory and time feeling to go by a bit faster.

its nothing unusual its the basic thing my life consists of. its as boring and common in my life like breathing air and it is chronic ADHD dystimia nothing unusual, even this random youtuber here knows about it (i Dont watch him i just randomly saw it) This guy has (in my estimation and according to research the types "inatentive" often refer to less severe cases according to Barkley but the exeption confirms the rule): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGTUtWyDofE&ab_channel=ADHDMastery
[09.09.2023, 13:01:45] Marco Luca Hefti: -Antivirus scan is stuck like always in the recent weeks. Well guess just a bug. I pressed a quick scan like 1 time today and i just noticed that it was stuck at 30 seconds for the hole day.
[09.09.2023, 13:03:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Writing for leisure on websites its part fun but could also be educational (writing with the most advanced LLM's.)
[09.09.2023, 15:14:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Some dosages may make it harder to feel such symthoms. Hard to say... Ill go shower. Victor wanned to give me 40 Equasim in secret when i was increasing to 30mg Equasim since i later got those unexpected heart rate increases i wonder what would have happened had i taken up that offer....
[09.09.2023, 15:34:21] Marco Luca Hefti: I have a small pack of 10mg Equasim, ~4 pieces 20mg Equasim and maybe 30 Equasim for 5-14 days left.

If i dont get the 20 Euasim then i would have to take those or go to 0mg and keep the 30 Strattera as is which might be uncomfortable idk.

V. Did not write back yet
[09.09.2023, 17:03:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Totaly forgot time could be more adhd because 20 Equasim, temporarily fluctuating things (working memory like old people suddenly forgetting multible goals and ur plans or one part of it is part of that.)

Also time seemed to fly even faster eight then and i got distracted.

Well it was clear im not at my best only ok/good relative to the bad recent years. Gona meet bad Bahnhof and drive to family
[09.09.2023, 23:07:03] Marco Luca Hefti: Mom is at a doctor her old Doctor recommended.

I was with her now im home.
[10.09.2023, 00:41:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Roommates forgot to close door very loud kitchen. But all good.
[10.09.2023, 10:03:22] Marco Luca Hefti: ADHD anhedonia and mild dystimia returned. Also i have this constant mild anxiety it seems also my cognition seems to be "blackout / gelähmt" by the day eventho slow. probably the 20 Equasim but not sure.
[10.09.2023, 10:04:10] Marco Luca Hefti: maybe becuase slightly shorter night becuase i was at mom + friend place to barbeque and it was far so until home it was late
[10.09.2023, 12:11:51] Marco Luca Hefti: A bit of discomfort when related around breathing or mild background anxiety since 20 Equasim. Nothing unusual has happened before. Exacerbated by less sleep today (5h sleep, 6h bed according to app) sleep does not always exacerbate or cause such things. In some ways less sleep can also have not much effect. On some ADHD dosages it seems more pronounced or my memory /uncontious attention better as to alert me to that fact. Basically all normal/fine (within the relative context of mild bad = good/the disfunctionality of bad treatment etc) just lower drive and motivation. Nothing new. I predicted it weeks in advance. I gave accurate assessments at every dosage change.

Talked to Asier in kitchen this morning he seemed to say when asked about entusijasm/drive/speed i seemed more like that now than with 30 or 40 (seemingly i seemed more calm/slow) there - while i feel less productive now. To be fair time could be going slower and discomfort could just be related to that.
[10.09.2023, 15:00:56] Marco Luca Hefti: When it comes to try out new sport out of my confort zone, the way im feeling more discomfort now than with 30 and 40 Euqaism id say this: all activity's are usually out of my comfort zone if im feeling like right now already.

i feel like 20 Equasim is too low and 30 Strattera is too much or i just have to get used to 30-40 Equasim or it is too little and in combination with 10-20 equasim higher Strattera would be good enought.

30 Equasim might have been the best so far but if strattera would be too much i would slowly get burned out over time where it would first work well and then get worse over time. This is not from me but from Victor M. But i can see this being the case.
[10.09.2023, 16:43:08] Marco Luca Hefti: -I am carring two phones still becuase the data transfer did not work so far. Also i am still impaired from meds/unknown so doing stuff is hard and i also have to apply for a job.
[10.09.2023, 18:15:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Kinda feeling like walks with brothers Parents and even Roomamte if they want to. Still more social and still higher motivation/drive then usual.
[10.09.2023, 18:20:10] Marco Luca Hefti: -Good day.
[10.09.2023, 18:39:41] Marco Luca Hefti: good/normal day. Since 20 Equasim more ADHD symthoms.
[10.09.2023, 18:53:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor meldet sich wieder wie das letzte mal das er mir die Medikamente plötzlich abgedreht hatte und ich dann mich nicht mehr erinnern konnte das ich weg wollte zu einem anderen Psychiater nicht mehr. Glaube das ist schon mal passiert. Keiner hat mir jeh etwas gesagt und Victor meinte es sei wegen "Pedofil Polizeiarbeit" und wegen "Paranuid" irgendwas. Ich bin aber ganz normal und das was war ist schon lange weg ich bin total normal und ansprechbar. 😟 Ich will nicht wieder 1-2 Jahre Depressiv 100kg sein und kaum denken können. Das ist schon das letzte mal passiert als ich arbeiten gehen wollte.
[10.09.2023, 20:08:23] Marco Luca Hefti: I had s loss of memory during Victors treatment maybe Medication restores my ability to remember.

I worrie a bit because i remember that i was in this situation before.

I never worked much at all for Dad (i did a bit) but most of the time i could barely remember and i wrote my daily journal in Victors Whatsapp chat.

I worrie that he might know this and use 
-paranoid (if i try to get help) (including my deep understanding of some topics and my humor of saying something over the top and the clarify after, might come across like that. When i swear im not. (At least i would like to have a calm conversation now and not when im on different medication and can barely remember again. Its bot just about the dosage it is also about what dosages came before im starting to think…)
-it looks like im stopping to work when in reality im starting to look for work. I guess i should have searched for Work without going to RAV (Victor suggested RAV to be the forst step and i did not remember last time he made me forget everything)
-And maybe some „pedophile thing“ might be used to block me from getting Speichermedien and the antivirus that can save Whatsapp Logs so i might not be able to protect my protocols that are mostly electronic)
[10.09.2023, 20:15:54] Marco Luca Hefti: I am writing English so it is easyer to listen to the logs with text to speech.
[10.09.2023, 20:17:27] Marco Luca Hefti: And he may also claim im psychotic eventho he never told me that i am, and use that to potentially have my protocolls / daily journals i write to protect myself from the potential of him doing that away. I dont know how psychosis works tho… gotta research it.

[11.09.2023, 17:47:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Herr Schneider in der UPK schin aus irgend einem Grund auch nur leicht genervt/aufgebracht das ich überhaupt in die walk in komme Herr Ostermeier Maximilian hatt sich für Ihn entschuldigt und konnte schien verblüfft nach seiner Reaktion. Ich hätte fragen sollen ob er weis wieso weil ich wollte Herrn Schneider nicht Reizen oder auch nur ansatzweise widersprechen. 

Es schien fast so als hätte Herr Schneider Michael schlechte Reports bekommen? Anders kann ich es mir nicht leicht erklären.

[12.09.2023, 07:16:46] Marco Luca Hefti: I went into the dark bathroom and suddenly my arm touched the arm of my roommate seemingly standing there. I guess he was thinking or something. And had tured the light off already😄

He said sorry and that he was done and it was just kinda funny. I said: “Oh! There is a human here?!” 😂

Before he had used the bathroom and the door was closed and light on. As always when its door open, and dark without movement or anything its usually empty.

That happened the forst time i can remember. Not worth mentioning but since it is kinda rare and im on the toilet now anyway ill write it. ^^
[12.09.2023, 12:00:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Somehow my old phone seemed to have recovered from the green screen/(waterdamage?) maybe the water dried out or something.

It had crazy problems and now it seems way better.

I seem to be yawning a lot. But since there where a lot of videos on youtube about Nose breathing being so healthy suposidly and because it feels kinds natural im kinda like yawning withouth yawning so just taking a deep breath throught the nose and eyes (especially the left one). (When a person yawnes th eye gets a bit wet somethimes right?)
[12.09.2023, 10:22:55] Marco Luca Hefti: -Feeling the ADHD and lack of drive/cognition as always when meds are low or wrong. So here some random stuff i was procrastinating about: 
Although it is possible to take out letters easily out of the WG "Briefkasten" without having a key it is a bit painful/not very elegant. You can just put your fingers in and take it out. I wonder if we should get a better solution than to have one key everyone can take when they need it since we are multiple people living in the WG and you gotta take it before you go so you can take the mail when leaving or returning but then the others dont have it so often 2 people dont sicne its not always put back. Luckely i have barely gotten Mail in the recent months. Basically just the RAV stuff and maybe some Bank Account routine stuff.
[12.09.2023, 10:54:07] Marco Luca Hefti: -Sent lover a cute good morning text to kickstart her day. (My cutie requested and really enjoyed morning and evening texts. Doing it for maybe more than a year.)
[12.09.2023, 10:55:13] Marco Luca Hefti: every morning and evening. Probably since we meet once in a while but became a habbit since she required it at some point.
[12.09.2023, 11:07:26] Marco Luca Hefti: -procrastinating on applying for job since i feel like im not getting the meds or i will stay on this and i have low d rive and time goes by quick. So im basically a normal human that is really slow and has bad E.F. function (R. Barkley PhD Theory 90%). I am doing more leisure activites which is usually a sign that:
-1) my drive is better when it is compared to doing little to nothing
or
-2) my drive is not strong enought to continue "trying" where i kinda "give up and try to sustain/reduce discomfort and keep doing stuff in order to stay active since eventho i don't feel depressed (except a chronic mild dystimia and anhedonia and maybe blunting (althoug it seems to be more anhedonia and dystimia like when i have 0 medications wehre depression and discomforts are strongest. Im basically normal just effort like sport or doing well on video games and especially paperwork or social stuff basically anything that is fun but requires effort and that requires effort but is not fun and my body does not spontaneously enjoy is shit in that way.)

Not suprising at all. The moment i had the drive/motivation strong enought to do all kinds of things for parts of the day and i was in the gym and did not have discomfort i already knew it is probably just fluctuating but then after feeling it for a week or two i could tell that it was slowly diminishing. So in retrospect i guess i hope i wont get in trouble for waiting til the last second maybe then i get my brain to work for me like with homework in school.

Its extreamly predictable. Im starting to get the hang of the meds too. As long as i do not crash and have memory problems like last time i was put on 0mg or some other dosage after meds where cut off because i made a report to police where i just said "I want to make this report" Here are some "hypothetical possibilitys i would like to include" i never expressed certaintly and i explicitly repeated that mutlible times to make it extra clear  but people seem to agressively ignore those parts and only hear select phraces. Anyway. This is just a contingency journal entry.
[12.09.2023, 11:10:15] Marco Luca Hefti: But i still do more than before since the 25% "official" Work contract with dad was most of the time 0% becuase of mental health/medication related work inability. Which i told the RAV Berater Herr Ochoa (same guy as another time, not sure but he seems familiar there was 1 woman and he last time and now again he i think) and i told my family i wrote it in the protocol Victor has access too and i told Victor when we meet. I also told UPK Herr Ostermeiyer Maximilian yesterday. Basically i told the hole world also when making the report 4-7 weeks ago.
[12.09.2023, 12:12:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Procrastinating listening to interviews with influencial, successful and/or knowledgeable people.

Somehow i have drive to do that to be fair it might be low effort or just somehow for whatever reason interessting to me eventhough i would much rather write down all med dosages, lerns psychiatry, or more likely: start/continue stuff as a enterpreneur/ doing Artificiall Intelligence stuff.

Its said sun is healthy so when i was depressed more / less drive i woupd not really go out to do that stuff now i do it without much effort.

So the effort barrier seems to still be better and higher up just below where normal is id say. The selfdrirected very controllable effort directing that is.

Selfdrirected goaldirected action in hirachies and nested in structures of Goals and subgoals. Or something roughly like that the most cited adhd scholar would say.
[12.09.2023, 13:13:26] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor hat wegen 20er Equasim Rezept Verlängerung geschrieben. Ich soll für 30 Minuten nach Schlossmatt Münchenstein kommen und er würde mir geben das Rezept würde kömmen es reche kurzfristig einfach nicht mehr rechtzeitig wenn ich nur noch für heute 20er Equasim hätte.
[12.09.2023, 13:43:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Ich bereue es etwas mich beim RAV angemeldet zu haben ich hätte wissen sollen das positive Veränderungen auch wenn sie für Wochen halten nicht halten. Aber ich dachte ich "beiss einfach in den Sauren Apfel und spring ins kalte Wasser und gehe Arbeiten egal wie ich mich fühle aber ich habe stärkere ADHD Focus Probleme bei Bewerben (ungefähr/ generell) und Missempfindungen welche ich fühle intuitiv und wenn das  Arbeiten noch dazu kommt könnte es ausbrennen/burnoutmässig. Auch anhedonia und dystimia adhds related sind tendenziell zurück. Arbeit = unter Leuten und noch mehr Struktur laut Victor würde das heissen, dass es dann leichte währe jemanden "Einzustellen". (Dosen zu finden) Was plausibel klingt.

Ich mein es war gut die motivation aber sie war nicht lange genug und ich werde vmt. immernoch einen Job antretten können aber schleppend und mit den Medikamenten könnte auch ein Fragezeichen sein.

-Werde auch nach Medikamenten Liste Fragen (Liste mit bis jetzt getesteten Dosen).
[12.09.2023, 13:57:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Protocolls are maybe less concise, but low drive and its better to do them bad then to not do them at all i guess there is a sweetspot...:

Feeling slightly stressed or uncomfortable (ADHD like or maybe its the strattera but i think it is also without medications although not so sure. Last time i went off meds was horrible but it was also kinda short and in the middle of ADHD medications so maybe if i had toughened through it i would have had more perspective.

Anyway.

Ill do the lower strattera test and then Ill have to see results/conclusions or really good explanations becuase 4 years is a lot.
[12.09.2023, 16:20:46] Marco Luca Hefti: Meeting with Medical Peer Victor Magnenat Schlossmatt. 17:00 Uhr

Wanna speak about things quickly, and see what he wants to do/has planed.
[12.09.2023, 16:22:58] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎You deleted this message.
‎[12.09.2023, 16:23:11] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[12.09.2023, 16:27:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe slightly more sweaty or feeling it more on 20mg Equasim (combined with 30mg Strattera) in the recent weeks.
[12.09.2023, 18:59:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor seemed slighty sad or stressed. He said he was a tiny bit stressed (of course he has lots to do with the doctor/medical University and all).

Seemed to be thinking i was seeming more like „not being as open as i should and writing everything and also when i said i can give all the Info but i may not want to send (sounded like all?) the RAV Dokuments.

And also asked if he can talk to a bunch i said if i am in cc email or we can go together or so.

I am willing to provide all info but just not maybe a tottal and complete and utter blanko check.

I reassured. Maybe reducing strattera like planed he worries (he „just worries“ that ) symthoms and  paranoid or „non trustful“ behaviour might increase so i said he can ask me anything i want.

I said i told walk in about the recent dosages like a few and. michael schneider and what he said and that i go to ZPP Therapy stuff and so on (Vorgespräch) i said nothing changes just a „Gespräch/Preliminary Talk“ Herr Schneider suggested and he might not be that big of a fan of (is not) the Victor Marco 4 Year constelation (and i think Here Schneider is smart about that) but i think so far it looks very resonable and i feel like i can think better without Guanfacine in the strattera Stimulant mix.

And maybe lower or no strattera might also do something but i will 100% follow Victors suggestion and go to 30 and 40 and see if i do more Pflichten/Opportunity-Responsibility-Paperwork To Do list stuff.

:) i cant remember all we talked maybe but that may be most of it.
[12.09.2023, 18:59:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Rest is in the normal protocol chat. ‎<This message was edited>
[12.09.2023, 19:01:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor somethimes looks like a smaller (but nontherless great) Version of Sascha (meaning he would almost fit as a brother but not saying he is just have similaritys haircaller face and so)
[12.09.2023, 19:03:12] Marco Luca Hefti: Happy with the talk 17:10 til 18:00 Victor could walk with me. I hope he can deal with the Stress and all.

I also told him about the Anzeige thing again and whatever i thought he might benefit from knowing without telling overly sensitive or private stuff of others.
[12.09.2023, 19:09:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Was a nice meet i thought. Just seemed a bit too  keen on my minimal privacy request in minimal ways. Almost unusually. He himself is extremely private tho (exept when he is not) and often declines to say many things when asked. 

Altho in the first 1-2 years he was telling me like everything almost or like the deepest deepest ultra private things well nothing bad, just stuff u would not tell someone u dont trust a bit or is kinda your good college or almost friend/friend.

Cant remember most things but defintily remeber the chage to being much much more reserved/lawyerly later.

Ja… I will do right by Victor M. and i think i am very careful or im strongly considering his side of things but maybe communication of what he wants and needs could be better. 🤷‍♂️ idk. Think went good. The meet

[12.09.2023, 19:29:03] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor said he thinks im “highly intelligent” but im having very strong problems at doing simple things like a “Bewerbung” “sending job applications or simple email/paperwork/focused things doing social/hobbies/aport club/selfcare stuff that require “Executive Function (R.B phd T.)” 
And he is totally right i can do a LOT but its just locker/ variable. Some meds it comes out so strong
[12.09.2023, 22:01:46] Marco Luca Hefti: Gracie writes very qute. She might be happy with me. Also roomate and people seem quite nice. I think im coming across not to bad. More likable slightly.
[13.09.2023, 13:55:18] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor seemed unhappy i mentioned that i could not work a lot during the mental health treatment thing. “Das goht s RAV nüt ah” i was not understanding why i would want to hide/keep that gor me since it seemed important for them to know.

[13.09.2023, 17:21:27] Marco Luca Hefti: The people on the opposite side of the house keep looking like why. Are they still spooked from when i meditated and looked at the sky for cyrcadian rythm.

Just coincidence but i ate for 20 minutes and from 5 times i looked 3 times some guy is standing there in the window looking at my vesinity. But i guess they are just interessted in architecture or something. 🤷‍♂️

I mean they dont smoke just stand there. Well who cares i do my thing.
[14.09.2023, 08:47:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Frau Rohmeder meinte ich solle nicht von Herrn Magnenat Victor Medikamente entgegen nehmen sondern bei der Apotheke einen Vorbezug machen, falls dieser nötig würde. Ich bin etwas in einer Notsituation/Abhänigkeits Situation und ich habe V schon gesagt das ich nur bei der Apotheke haben möchte, aber ich vergesse es vorallem wenn er mir plötzlich die Strattera usw abdreht und ich mich kaum an Dinge erinnern kann. Momentan ist mein Gedächnis durchaus gut/stabil mehr als auch schon und es ist eigentlich gut/ich glaube es ist immer da aber das erinnern/denken auf gewissen Medikationen oder plötzliche Absenz ist schwer.
[14.09.2023, 11:27:36] Marco Luca Hefti: I told Frau Rohmeder about 25% and barely work thing again (already did on last meet with Victor a few months ago when i was somehow having a way easyer time to train way more.). I reiterated that (while i had took Victors recommendation on RAV) i had taken steps and did more things out of a feeling of increased agency and drive/adhd reduction and the look of outside seeming like a job ended was in fact a improvement. (However i also said im not perfect and also mentioned about "laying flat" i believe in the recent 4 years and that i might do something else if there would be significant Deterioration as i also mentioned to victor when we meet without being acusatory just mentioned it again that 4 years is a bit of time and "i hope i wont lose memory recall and go to year long overweight depression again"

Also she told me i could call her for a appointment but that she had little time right now since 20% work and she gets here "plan" in October and then she can make a appointment in Oktober or November and she could say "provisionaly/provisorisch" that i can do 2. of November but that would not be sure, so i asked what would be best for her and she said that if i can call in Oktober then she can do it then. Also that she was booked up like crazy (paraphracing).

She said the perscription Apotheke would come and that if she is not there i could make a Termin with Herr Schneider Michael. I said that i was in walk in and that i did not at that time get a perscription.   And I explained that i had had a appointment with Herr Schneider at one time.
[14.09.2023, 21:11:54] Marco Luca Hefti: I was recommended: "Jordan Peterson - How Narcissistic Psychopaths Fool You" by youtube. Its a short video and peterson althog i do often not agree is very eloquent so i watched it he mentiones a psychopath narsicisist and its interessting to so googled the name.

[15.09.2023, 12:50:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Told Victor. at our last meet that with 40 Equasim (at least initially” i liftet less weight but i was more motivated to go to the gym the next day and even after training and also enjoyed the training somehow more despite. Maybe form better not sure maybe same or not.

Meet with v was like ~4 days ago

[15.09.2023, 18:34:23] Marco Luca Hefti: I remembered last time i visited Victor and a few other times the guy living at Victors place with the tractor drove down the hill and right up again. I dont know what he was doing but he was down and up while i was walking up the hill to Victor and seemed to look at me and when i looked back trying to see if i should greet if he greets he smiled/laughted a bit and looked straight forward. Maybe Victor asked him to check something out about how i walk up or who im with. But thats unlikely and far reaching. I guess it was just coincidence and he had to do something that only took 30 seconds so he drove down the multi tonn big tracktor down and up. Maybe mail or collected something.

Maybe victor asked him to check if i "greet" or something. :) I noticed that last time when i was slightly worried and walked up the hill too. Or some other times. Its is quite rare to happen that i see the tractor and even more rare when it turns and drives right back up.
[15.09.2023, 18:37:55] Marco Luca Hefti: "Suggestion: Connect your phone to the computer" I have no idea why that pops up so much recently or how to turn it off. Why would i need to be suggested to plug my phones into the computer. It works without them 😹

[16.09.2023, 13:36:35] Marco Luca Hefti: I send vc mail RAV update but did not do overly much. Low motivation so talk to LM and try to selfmotivate. Basically procrasinating.

[16.09.2023, 14:07:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Especially in the last ~6-8 weeks.
[16.09.2023, 14:09:18] Marco Luca Hefti: Not the first time in my life by any stretch but its nice to wash more than 2-4 times a month, not 75% fat ans to have a shaved face.
[16.09.2023, 16:06:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Raw text before reducing it for later review of examples of "losing focus" taken from a conversation:

"
It goes with: "Following a period of enhanced focus, one might experience decreased comfort, including feeling tense, being unable to find a comfortable sitting position, being more sensitive to temperature and airflow, and finding the pressure of the body against furniture more noticeable. These discomforts necessitate frequent adjustments to find brief relief. This complex scenario is challenging to succinctly describe as "lack of focus", yet it generally involves a heightened difficulty in sustaining effort and desire toward goal-directed activities."


The more one maintains focus on tasks perceived as not inherently rewarding (such as paperwork), the greater the discomfort that can arise. This discomfort frequently nudges one towards engaging in activities that offer immediate, intrinsic rewards, providing temporary relief. These activities can vary greatly — sometimes they are beneficial, while other times they can be seen as distractions, like biting nails or playing with a Rubik's cube. This diversion to seeking immediate relief can often cause an 'attentional blink', a term coined by B. Ph.D., where one momentarily loses sight of their broader goals, being caught up in the relief. The more one yields to these distractions, the harder it becomes to maintain sustained focus, creating a cycle of reduced productivity and increasing discomfort.



The more one maintains the non intrinsic/useful focus (e.g. towards paperwork in that moment) the more the discomfort increases when focus is broken or directed to intrinsically rewarding activitys (somethimes very useful other times very much seemingly not like biting nails, rubicscube or studying some information, food, rest, expercise, a sudden thought while temporarily forgetting time and goals mildly like a "attentional blink" as B. phd would say[...]
Examples of sometimes more often intrinsically rewarding things where the human would go to get releave formt he discomfort from the main task/the goals he would rathter try to follow by kinda "feeling the moment and the body" and then when the body wants to nail bit then that. Right now for example it would feel uncomfortable and bad to bite my nails i would never do it . But the body somethimes seems to punish you and give you a choice to relieve it and be rewarded that is the "disctraction" as it is called right there! 


(the more one does the most effitient and effective focus the more the discomfort increases even up to brain becoming slow/empty or most often forgetting context and when context is small enought the "regaining of lost context already gives opportunity for further context to be forgotten add to it the slowness of the mind and dristracting discomforts and dystimia meaning plesurable activitys (few and week far in between) make "recharging" harder wich when ignored can seemingly to my exp lead to burn out. Now it is not the comfortable kind of discomfort where there is a improvement in the end, but im sure it is probably healthy to tackle it..)""
[16.09.2023, 17:15:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Random journal: Most videos i watch on YouTube are by recommendation. Meaning a algorythm recommends a bunch by some criteria its a matter of probabilitys and past engagements. 

So basically somethimes its suddenly personality disorders and psychology, then it is manufacturing or silly videos then lectures, interviews or nature documentarys. It recommends even rarely watched ones.

[16.09.2023, 18:42:34] Marco Luca Hefti: V. once said he did Strattera monotherapy high dosage and felt terrible almost killed himself and brother had terrible experiences with Dr Eich. The guy I told V. Herr Dubach sent me to and that i told V he recommended/wanned to start to try monotherapy Strattera somehting i have not tried yet. So maybe he was gaslighting but that would mean red flaggs are not just coincidences. All good im sure its true and just wanned to write that again, because writing down the few negative thoughts one has is said to be therapeutic in daily journals. :)

[17.09.2023, 15:21:26] Marco Luca Hefti: 40 Eq does not seem to do very much. As expected the eq does not feel like at that time when it was way better for a moment it seemed very much timed by victor he even moved the meet corrolating to how i felt. Anyway. That is the unlikely hypothesis probably was just busy.... anyway last days are kinda shit for productivity but i got minimal drive to do the most fun things so im a happy depressed person without feeling sad or without losing rationality purely emotional/drive/recall/quickness and such.

[18.09.2023, 11:54:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Still quite impared like the last 4 years and ADHD / with comorbid dystimia or just a veeeery strong ADHD, when it comes to drive and variability of executive function, over my life.

By coincidence there have been many things happening. But obviously its predictable that the looking for job thing would be very slow and hard ive been spending way too much time on it and if my brain worked or i did not have such insane "lack of dopamine" leaving all the discomfort to be and becoming stronger often when continued even causing anxiety or the brain to become blank like as if you Dont rememeber and in the context of the task meaning that the mental ressources for the task are almost withheld from you.

"a strong aversion, where despite understanding the benefits of completing a task, there is a subconscious resistance that is creating discomfort and hindering progress. It's like a form of self-sabotage where your subconscious is not aligned with your conscious intentions, creating a kind of internal friction or inertia that is hard to overcome. This can be a common experience for individuals with ADHD, where there is a disconnect between wanting to accomplish something and being able to muster the sustained effort and focus to do it. It's a complex dynamic where the subconscious aversion can sometimes override conscious desires, leading to procrastination, avoidance, and a cycle of frustration and self-criticism. It's a deep-seated resistance that goes beyond mere lack of interest or motivation. It's almost as if there is a barrier preventing engagement, despite a conscious desire to do so."


hard to describe in short.
[18.09.2023, 11:55:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Its like you cant really write a essay when ur taking 5 different drugs even if you are normal and rational otherwise your brain just does not really seem to work. Its like that. Or when you did not sleep but i think normal people would probably even work in those situation. idk..... complex i guess

[18.09.2023, 12:52:55] Marco Luca Hefti: I feel like the "retirement thing" was a thing before.... kinda feel like a deja vu but under the hole medications victor plan of the last 4 years im very careful with Memorys... It would make no sense for such things to happen exept if stuff i spoke with V and my logs would have been insanely taken out of context and misrepresented but that surely cant be.

Well. If yes then some irregularitys and things i wrote over the years would make sense i have told a bunch of people. If no then its also fine since its just a contingency thing since 4 years. Since he started helping me when i said something out of anger of seemingly egoistic/cold careless things which is not that bad only a insanely psychop. narcessit. person would hold such a insane grudge. 😂 And although it is well documented that they exist all the time i think its low % probability. Very low. :) Just writing this anyway. Why not. Hurts nobody and writing logs is said to be good in case you suspect someone to maybe be Psy.path, sociop, or narcissist.

[18.09.2023, 13:06:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Pretty normal days. Just a bit more drive and less memory problems and less anhedonia. Pretty similar to the recent ~1 year. Or the time after guanfacin.

The only problem i am STILL having is that i was more motivated and therefore went to RAV on recommendation of my peer and so the "mental health friendly work when you can so super rare" job of dad (25% pensum) is gone so now i gotta apply for work, my psychiatrist is gone coincidently (it was known about a year or 7-8 months in advance of course) and my doctor also retired by coincidence just now which was also known months and months in advance. Like 10 months or so.

So i hope this is not some "Marco regains his memory" gotta prepare to be able to underminde his credibility in case he remembers some of the strange stuff that happened during the last 4 years thing. But im fine i Dont have a problem with anyone just writing logs for contingency in cause something really bad is going on like trying to revenge by guiding someone so they Dont find dosage and "punish" them with wrong dosages while telling them "well its tests you gotta push trhough" soon we find ur perfect dosage or in the future and where can you go anyway you are super low drive and its hard for you or because confidence issues it is very hard for you to get prescription for your ADHD meds. And all under the mantle of "how im just concerned about common things like psychosis".

But again this is totally not the case because then it would not be so psychotic at all but pretty resonable. And if it is NOT the case then no faul no harm. :) Right now i have no reason to suspect much since all seems good......... And if it is not then something is wrong since i have not done anything wrong or barely anything. And if all the small things ive done who are trivial are known that would be a BIG sign that it could be the case that someone is misuing there status and trust to get dirt and then report everything in the worst light possible.

Just as a very low % contingency. Altho a lot of coincidences seem to happen and combined with all the red flaggs i documented (next to the normal documentation for medication tiltration when LM's can crawl chatlogs (they already can but its super inneffitient and i lack the motivation to really do it right now and i tust Victor and my Doctors to find it by trial and error.....eventho it has been 4 years and its honetly more the V. method of trial and error the doctor only approves medication perscriptions and such. :) So Ive been making logs since 4 years. Just now more since it seems like a prime time to do things and complex context. If anyone is reading this then something is wrong and you have been mislead or ur being used and fooled by what is the most "easy" explanation. Because i heared that there is a lot of real psychosis i guess. But im pretty sure im not and if i am noone ever told me. Noone. Not even a talk (exept Victor maybe but he said a lot of crazy things that are probably just "tests" as he said once to gauge my medicaiton.)
[18.09.2023, 13:07:42] Marco Luca Hefti: trust*
[18.09.2023, 13:12:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Told me Doctor "loves" me. "That im investigated for underage things" "Would put me in the psych if i was not working." "If somone tells on V. then i would revenge by going throught past and anything i know with excell and contact all people they had beef with to get dirt on them and so on." Or actually that is not a correct quote it was in case of "Dont talk about my iq" and "Some people do that" (giving plausable deniability if he ment that" but i guess he was just helping me in understanding that "some" people (but not him) would not like it if i even said any "secret" which i was super careful and trying not to say. So it seemed a bit strange. But i guess maybe a "test" or someting or "humor". Althoug usually he does not laugth at my jokes super rarely (which is a bit .... well i guess he just is super serious cool head or smth... totally nothing else) and make very very little jokes. But i think he made jokes before im pretty sure. ^^ Maybe just a case of authoritys beign too quick to judge things and V. just tring to not be bothered which would be another trivial explanation. :)
[18.09.2023, 13:14:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Okay enought logs for now (those are contingency ones so in 99% of likelyhood useless anyway :) But writing is healthy and better than gaming i guess.... since im procrastinating on the CV a bit anyway. Eventho i am engaged and contacted dad to review and am doing the picture (since the old CV still has the old picture eventho i look pretty similar. :)
[18.09.2023, 13:15:02] Marco Luca Hefti: -No anxiety breath today.

[18.09.2023, 13:58:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Im late i think it might be better to wait til after the 40Eq kicks in dont wanna give a excuse to misjudge me. And judges have been reported to reject parole/judge people harsher when they havent eaten in a long time and more leanient when they have eaten (that was the idea with waiting til after the 12:00-13:30 break so they have eaten and are sharp 😂😊
[18.09.2023, 14:01:40] Marco Luca Hefti: But i mistimed it because i was missing the timing because i was not motivated to prepare early and did shower last second like prepare to go somewhere on a appointment last second like is typical for low drive/ADHD depression similar thing. Its a problem of not being motivated like a younger human that only cares about more immediate things and cant supress the discomfort or "create the dopamine/drive just by willpower" that will make the discomfort go away and activate the mental abilitys as if you where "paying" so to say for noradrenaline with dopamine (just a hypothesis of mine since dopam. is synthesized from norad. as i read on Wikipedia when my brain was better and i felt brilliant and told V then forgot and he told me or i heared from V or some YouTube video..... cant remember which one.....) anyway. Russel Barkley has great presentations on "executive functions" and neuropsychology on that.

Its pretty simple honestly if you ignore the baggage.
[18.09.2023, 14:02:03] Marco Luca Hefti: Or dont get "lost" in the details ^^
[18.09.2023, 14:06:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe the "ADHD" dont care about small things like paperwork or details just give me the big picture people are better at synthesizing (not sure if that word applyes) or reducing/destilling a lot of info into smaller conenctions. One hypothesis of mine on humans as a social species..... but that for a other time.... I can work on CV a bit (or try to) and see if i can use the "kicking in" of the 40 Eq (eventho strattera might be int he way or something else) to maybe get something done. Or try to "plan" what to do next.

-probably reviwing and continuing TransFair of to-do list i miraculesly was motivated to do after the recent months and during that "boost" of motivation that was intersperced with the "worrie/too much coffee phases" but then also [relaxed motivation/better social intuition and other great things] :)

[18.09.2023, 16:10:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Somethimes feel like im a criminal for getting adhd medication medication it makes little sense that im tense. 


I feel like i have to explain myself just in case this message is seen as “psychotic” or smth. which would be ridiculous:
So low % contingency probably not nessesary text:

I guess i just dont trust that people are thoroughly educated and bias free i guess.

Feels ridiculous somethimes but i guess its just that i over worrie too much about corruption or quick judgement people or that any imperfections lead to stupid people blocking me from the most effective adhd meds and that is also a prime candidate for “revenge-psychopath-reputation-attack-inorder-to-discredit people that the p. may feel poses a threat to there reputation or just they feel they ‘challenged them’ or simething stupid”.

So bad reports = you will never get ur perfect medication because blocked feom stimulant medication group (wich is by far the most  effective on average and goes to dopamine and has way higher effect size than all the non stimulants).

It also helps to write down worries even if small not like im plaged by them, but “just in case” usually i let emergencys happen and i am calm because with this little motivation adhd is a life of “emergencys” like homework too late or not at all or taxes or whatever. Its kinda like being depressed but trying to be positive and not being sad maybe. 🤔 So other people would flip out but that does not help so im calm because eather im motivated and healthy and do something about it that is super hard and needs great working memory and motivation or i stay calm. Panik never helps it just undermines credibility when people are quick to judge and even if not. It also cases unnecessary stress and therefore hampers thinking and regeneration.

However its complex… and the line of where energy ends and stress beginns is not always so clear.
[18.09.2023, 16:17:26] Marco Luca Hefti: I might feel like im having less clarity or memory when i think about 40 Eq but its hard to say. The 30 Str might also hammper the ability to feel delicate stuff not sure tho. (being less sensitive) 

So i would say to 40 Eq = more motivated less discomfort (or also being bothered)
before 40 Eq = maybe feeling like i can remember more quickly but honestly it seems to often "come back" after being used to 40 Eq or some time passes. And i Dont think its always. That "not being sure" is why i like to have a lot of sample size before i make judgements.
[18.09.2023, 16:19:02] Marco Luca Hefti: or "quickness to remember" but with EQ i feel like many things are better. Like the ability to do things i think is better than the 10 days on 20Eq recently but it might just be that i havent fully recovered from 30 and 40 in case that hypothesis is the case. Anywhow gona write less..... always feel like stuff can be taken out of context otherwise...
[18.09.2023, 17:33:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Wrote dad because of Job he offered to maybe see if he can go around the "paperwork" to get a job. I guess i have massive confidence issues. Because i seem to have problems sending my CV even if others would do it way quicker. I have not had the "clarity and confidence" to decide its good enought and that i did not "miss" something so to say.

[18.09.2023, 21:00:34] Marco Luca Hefti: I am also having less discomfort so i stand somethimes while doing stuff

Somethines i have a hard time deciding what to buy and so on maybe it has to do with equasim and maybe strattera at 34mg would be optimal Victor said recently when i asked what medication *he was taking currently* he said 34mg Strattera with a laught/smile/smirk/or wink cant rememeber so i was wondering if he just said what i have or that he thinks i will mirror so ge said smth. he thinks is benefitial for me to have in mind.
[19.09.2023, 08:15:28] Marco Luca Hefti: took a long time to wake up i felt kinda meh or not very high drive.

[19.09.2023, 14:55:18] Marco Luca Hefti: On way to gym
[19.09.2023, 15:14:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Somethimes some lady seems hot but then turns out to be probably below legal age limit its not always obvious because some old ones look young and young ones look old. Usually when seeing the face and some seconds suffice but when craweled up or turned away its hard to quickly decide.
[19.09.2023, 15:44:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Gym dude looked eather normal or like i had made a bad report but as i always wrote in Victor accessable detailed Daily Journal and Medication related Protocoll whatasapp Chat i had made almost only good reports when asked by email about how they are doing and even when a bit less good when i for example did not like that the gym did not buy C but a LOT of X then it was more directed towards Gym not staff.

All in all i guess i would classify it as normal. 🤷‍♂️

Oh i also wrote some trainers are hot but that was the old trainer that is now retired and she was definitly old altho small. She even seemed to date that definitly older than me guy. I guess 31 but at that time i was like 27-28.

The other trainer seems kinda strange she seems not to very much like me for some reason. Dont know why. Often have that feeling that people dont like me for no good reason.
[19.09.2023, 16:07:30] Marco Luca Hefti: -I like the long serving Gym staff guy that plays yu gi oh according to him.

(Obviously platonically im not into males my advocacy for fucked groups of people is because of principles im absolutely into women. Although i could be depending on meds have a feel like im almost slighty bi but not really once made joke to V.)

The hottest ladys are trained look old when young and young when old are kinda nice but bad (meaning super horny or confident and non shy when it comes to sexuality stuff but could be super shy in any other way way:
Somethimes deep voice eapecially when young is hot or very female voice too. But its really complex i also like people that are super friendly (not supericial or just kinda like me for some reason and dont seem like they jump to 10 concussions about me before having interacted with me for 1 minute)

Also im super shy but when adhd are right i think my shyness stays the same but my social intuition and the confidence to know what to do and not to do comes (more what to do what not to do does not work because if i have no clue i have to guess)
[19.09.2023, 16:14:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Super confident hot halv a 1/4 - 3/4  head smaller than my head pony tail or sticked up hair or all kinds of stuff just for fun or none or little and so on seems hot. Also 29-26 years and smart but not fake or needing to be proud exept for fun but not not proud just no need to show since ja.

But all does not matter but seems like a hot profile.

But im pretty flexible since there are very few 1993 people not many people born in that year i heared and discussed once with Victo
[19.09.2023, 16:39:33] Marco Luca Hefti: -Brand New trainer dude + Lady seem here all time since 1-2 months.
[19.09.2023, 16:43:03] Marco Luca Hefti: Right eye lid sub eyelid very rarely seems to show some blood movement or amth. Like once ever week or month.

Victor once asked me a few tomes if i can feel that i said barely or not maybe depending on dosages or so.

Not aure why also happens without meds i think but rare its kinda like when ur eyelid moves but falls again when ur like “wtf is this” but seems different. Maybe it has to do with 40 Eq or hinger in combo with 30 Eq idk..
[19.09.2023, 16:43:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Probably not nessesary to comment but somethimes i comment about details especially if spotlighted by V:
[19.09.2023, 17:18:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Some of my songs in gym i guess people can vote for them online to influence what ahould be played or call/writte/donate.

To be fair my ao ga contain a lot of ao gs that i obly like a small part of song like refreain or smth.
[19.09.2023, 18:08:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Any lady that looks roughtly maybe in my age range and in legal age will be checked to see if they seem to young to look at.

Not sure.
[19.09.2023, 19:27:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Chemical Imprisonment is the idea but im sure that would have been seen through by autoritys they would not be this stupid. Luckily that is only a worrie based on years of strange things said by V... I hope.
[19.09.2023, 19:28:43] Marco Luca Hefti: Well all good. I feel less depressed and for a while i even wanned to get work and everything. Right now im waiting for doctors to check if i can make employment "Bewerbungen" but they coincidently are are absent. If i ever read this. Change ur doctors. And go to court or different police idk....

Herr Theobald also said that I should contact Victor i think last time he tried to communicate with Victor (it seemed to maybe be not very easy since after 1-3 Months of doing that and that Victor Magnenat did not readily respond maybe/i think Herr Theobald said to me. (im not sure what he said but there was some mild frustration and the Strattera Perscription seemed to not come 3x in a row for unknown reasons. Victor said he and Frau Rohmeder are in Holyday and that Frau Rohmeder had a lot to do i think).
Herr Theobald said that he was not aware of a call also not Frau Blechner. I already wrote Victor in Whatsapp like we almost always communicate.

[20.09.2023, 11:31:26] Marco Luca Hefti: Not just the last 4 years but mainly in guess. Its not much just certain quite targeted things it is quite predictable and follows clear patterns.
[20.09.2023, 12:05:40] Marco Luca Hefti: It sucks that i cant go to holyday with my adventure starved maus obviously i told V all about that and so in i think i am too trustful / tell things somethimes…. But should be fine if it matters then that would be super unlikely. It was also hard 1.5-3 years ago with all the meds change and cognition… then…
[20.09.2023, 12:25:21] Marco Luca Hefti: -I do feel some working memory limitations like almost always but its quite rare. But somethimes those variable moments where i forget i had some “Sauerkraut” in a small thing in the microwave or that i forget some of the details of other plans or what i wanted to do while doing something else. Also breath somethimes still seems slightly supressed but not all of the time often it is also normal and great.

It could be that sideeffects slowly reduce.

I did of course not choose the dosage Victor did.

The plan of V. as he told me last meet at 12.9.23 was to see if i dis more Chores/more work at sending CV (obviously he knows that its really hard for me to do that kind of work and he also said that he would not have gone to apply for jub but just for a course last meet but i thought I remember him saying i should go there to get a job and so on when i wanned to do CV stuff and he then suggested to go there. I thought he said take everything and see how it goes but im not aure of that definitly dad told me to take all but 1 option on the Formula.

Eating Lunch then doing some meditation/leisure and whenever motivated or before/at ~14:30 seriously do work 1. adjust what dad sent me and then go to the website of RAV and look for a suiting work.

Attention problems are still quite strong (which means relative normal for me in the last 4 years average but severe relative to other adhd people i guess).
[20.09.2023, 13:05:54] Marco Luca Hefti: long scan started this morning seemed to be stuck and only use very little system ressources had to cancle i guess.
[20.09.2023, 13:59:44] Marco Luca Hefti: -knüble wenig (selte - viel wenniger als ohni medikament und viel wenniger als im durchschnitt in de letste 4 Johr.)
[20.09.2023, 14:00:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Antivirus keeps getting stuck i guess there are just constant updates recently. Maybe a busy month in terms of Bugs/Security. :)
[20.09.2023, 14:01:41] Marco Luca Hefti: -worked cv /slow like most of the time maybe strattera to blame not sure
[20.09.2023, 14:02:04] Marco Luca Hefti: or ADHD idk
[20.09.2023, 14:25:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Apotheke hat angerufen und gesagt Victor hätte angerufen und das Equasim Rezept wäre beantragt und würde kommen. Die Apotheke (Frau Blechner hat mir klar mitgeteilt das die Apotheke einen Vorbezug machen würde selbst wenn es bis dahin noch nicht angekommen wäre.)
[20.09.2023, 14:28:44] Marco Luca Hefti: Random protocol: 
-heartbleed, shellshock, promt injection are interessting. Had some coreisolation problems, disabled some script protection in windows shell, made firewall exception once closed it quickly and hat gpt isntall all kinds of unknown to me librarys/packages/terminal things as well as Linux on my pc.
[20.09.2023, 16:44:12] Marco Luca Hefti: -i feel exhausted from the boredom of cv work my work there is so slow and discomfort increases and is already so strong when i dont distract myself constantly.
[20.09.2023, 16:44:48] Marco Luca Hefti: nothing new but without attention its really draining eventho i barely do much. just like without medication or on wrong medication. maybe the only slightly less sleep also is to blame.
[20.09.2023, 17:38:26] Marco Luca Hefti: Right ear red left ear not.  Maybe after special meditation
[20.09.2023, 18:09:55] Marco Luca Hefti: discomfort 
tention body flat breathing maybe often
feels like a bit too much coffee
time goes by a bit quicker
[20.09.2023, 19:06:59] Marco Luca Hefti: -finished the CV changes planed for today
[21.09.2023, 06:35:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Secret lover everyone especially V. knows about seems distant since a while dont know why.
Recently she had a rose and 2020 in her profile i guess something nice happened back then. Once clicked on profile and saw it it was changed.
‎[21.09.2023, 06:48:00] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[21.09.2023, 06:53:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Its super unlikely she was more weight back then and V. Told me that with right meds he had a easy time dating all kinds of woman and no problem at all. The onky reason he would have done it is to cause max. harm and misuse medical trust and that  surely cant be the case because of doctor codex. :)

Just writing into logs anyways contingency just in case because if that where to be true covert slander would also be way more likely.

But again all totally 0.000000001% less likely than being hit by lightning. :) ⚡️
[21.09.2023, 07:01:33] Marco Luca Hefti: I told V. the only person i could think very get/wanned me in my life and she was one of the things left when i had very little.
And that i wanned to lick/finger cum/kiss her but she would rarely let her. At some point she just completely refused to let me do those evwntho she came 99% of them its almost like she did not mind not cuming as if she had something else that was worth it but telling her you can meet V. but sont favorite things with M. so she would not be into M. is a even more unlikely its like Psychopath level 9999% its like misusung medication to torture someone for just feeling threatened in status.
A person like that would would basically be super dangerous but that is so unlikely porbably 0.000000000000000000001% and not even a win-lose but pure lose-neutral.

😂 but just in case this log is read (it should not be noone has access) then something is off and the likelyhood rises a bit but ja. All great 👌😇
[21.09.2023, 07:08:27] Marco Luca Hefti: And he would tell her to flash the date exactly at this time 😂😂. Man the fantasy. I write the most strange and rare thought into my daily journal so this does not represent my normal Landscape of thoughts at all that of course is obvious to everyone with a brain. Its also the same thing for therapy where you talk about outlayers and such.
[21.09.2023, 07:26:29] Marco Luca Hefti: If it was done with good intentions (and not just a alibi in case being found out by investigators) then im fine. I know hon wants to travel and experience and while im depressed/dont find my meds i cant really do much. Im fine to have less sex or when she wants smth else 0% problem. Im not jealous the *only* thing i found not find nice is doing on purpose AND trying to blackmail her into having the worst time with me and blocking me from asking any other woman since Gracie *demands* complete monogamy and is very stringent about it. So if telling her “dont meet him now” “meet him now” “curse at him now” “suggest to him x now” “dont let him do plesurebal thing Y i will do better instead dont worrie” such things as part of covert manipulation of misusing medictions and my trust in “help with adhd meds” would be the only thing i would care about.

A simple covert affair i dont care about. 😊
[21.09.2023, 07:39:28] Marco Luca Hefti: I have other things to worrie and its a win-lose i find lose-lose more senseless and discussting. At least when im robbed the robber gets money. Still bad but not a robber that robs me and burs my money when im in desperation that would be more annoying. But karma does not really seem real so i would not rule things out i have sen people do such things with lower stuff before in school and “Lager” some people just have nothing better to do.

But its extremly unlikely and even if maybe they have bad but underatandable reasons. Also if my poor honey is better off its a win for me. ☺️ Eventhough she curses and tells me im nothing to her i know her life might not be perfect and her dreams maybe unfulfilled. I am tough in taking i will be fine. Eventually karma or if there is some justice my win-win stance and kindness and forgiving attitute throughout my life even when im fucked by mental health will come back and i will be better off.

Of if not i at least know i had a shit life being a good person and othe people can lern and be selfish, opportunistic, psychopaths without contience seeing that it works great and there is no justice exept manipulatable dumb justice that hits the wrong people anyway. So i dont have to revenge since im eather rewarded for doing good or the knowledge of people that being good is a bad strategy and only superficial good and doing good only when people recognice it and being without principals otherwise is a great strategy will spread and be ingrained in the DNA of the future and pockets of cooperation will outcompete our place and everyones children will be living in that world which “justice” without me having to fall from grace at all.

Also i can just think of people worse off than me and all my pain/pitty i might feel will disappear and i will only feel empathy and a desire to do smth about it and have a good life eventually.

Cant bring me down because my wellbeing is coupled indirectly at a lot of others if known or not.

That is karma i guess. 🌈😇

[21.09.2023, 09:07:45] Marco Luca Hefti: I closed the door more last months. But not always. I always did it since 7 years since some roomates just come in with barely or no knocking and also because i have medications in the room and other reasons like somethimes the door opens when you Dont close it etc.
[21.09.2023, 09:36:38] Marco Luca Hefti: -feeling more relaxed and deeper more lighter and unimpeeded breath. It is also 3hours and some minutes after 40 Eq it could be some delayed release of the Equasim medicaton causing this as it is said to have a second release about 3-4 hours after the initial one. However it might be slightly early.
[21.09.2023, 09:37:13] Marco Luca Hefti: Not writing everything especially the positive stuff somethimes is written down not enough i guess...
[21.09.2023, 10:23:31] Marco Luca Hefti: -short home workout
[21.09.2023, 10:36:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Gracie said paraphrace "Dont know. Maybe when i joined WhatsApp" I thought she was on WhatsApp since like 2017-2018. Well no priority to find out anyway. 

-I wonder if the audiobook "beyond infinity" is good..

[21.09.2023, 17:05:30] Marco Luca Hefti: -Like Dad asked me to make changes and send the CV back. I did. Its about getting a other person to check it. Was quite angry that im not doing more and all "even if it is justified". He got lots of work to do as well i guess. Also said what im gona do if i don't i hope the words of dad have a emotional effect on my subcontious/ADHD/drive since i know this all logically. But i feel more motivated and did some stuff now and during the phone call. I think it was positive even if some might say a bit hostile from h side i did not feel that way i think it was very healthy.
[21.09.2023, 17:07:11] Marco Luca Hefti: -Poor dad i feel bad if he feels bad. But its not like its not obvious and my life is not shit i just cant controll my brain or whatever it is. Im easily capable of 10000x more work. But im preaching to the quire in my protocol here.

[22.09.2023, 09:01:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor talked about that there is "Fight, flight, freeze and fawn" and i honestly feel most of the years in "freeze" subcontiously cognitive slowdown not quite freeze but enought to basically be at the lowest active still non disabled level maybe? If that where the case then it would be a unlucky coincidence that it is exactly at that level. Maybe it has to do with ADHD and anxiety
[22.09.2023, 09:50:51] Marco Luca Hefti: im sitting with the cover letters but i struggle to do the most discomforting things or to remember where to start. Breath seems to supress when i try

[22.09.2023, 15:09:14] Marco Luca Hefti: -some time back when the last company called the call also went to the old phone who has no active sim card and provider it seemed strange but i guess maybe you can take calls without a simcard that is payed anyway. Surely the company that called (i think it was Oven or the Airvent in the Bathroom) Dont have my WhatsApp and i am pretty sure it was a normal call and no WhatsApp call. Well i guess it is just some function of Iphones to have calls go to the old phone? Althoug for 99% of calls that never happens/happened. Mia once said people can do that "call when sim is deactivated/absent to check peoples reaction or something" when she talked about the play music in media marked or so. Not sure

[22.09.2023, 15:28:35] Marco Luca Hefti: -Right eye seems to very rarely have some blood movement or some movement but not sure. Once V. made me aware that my right eyelid (the lower one) was moving. It seems quite rare. It is depicted in cartoons somethimes but its not that storng its very very very subtle id say. Also when bored then i set less upright becuase it causes more discofort to sit nicely upright in that moment (other times over the months and years it feels unkomfortable to not sit upright so its definitly not about the positition itself but about the psychology at that moment.)

-Also when i meditate my eyes get wet after a while maybe it has to do with boredom or discomfort corrlation maybe stress not sure. Maybe a lowering of NE idk. I would have to research why yawning (it is without yawning here but the yawn feel often goes with it) somethimes causes partially wet eyes.
[22.09.2023, 15:33:43] Marco Luca Hefti: -It is important to know that i do not really feel stressed it is more the boredom and pressure when doing boring tasks i guess hard to explan maybe a agressive lack of dopamine/focus/attention/mental engagement? Hard to say

[22.09.2023, 16:19:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe i need coffee. Not sure. Victor seemed to have talked (*Details Start*: not directly but said he does not need coffee with right meds anymore and drinked a lot followed by a trubling storry of Coffein overdosage or smth might have been gaslighting but i think it was honest and just a report but i cant totally completely rule that out, and about his brother and Eich and troubles and that he does not want me to tell other people because private but could have also been gaslighting against Eich when i told him exactly what Herr Psychiater Dr Eich said when Herr Dubach helped me make a appointment with him once and he said some things that turned me off like "fertig mit Spass" no idea what he ment but i was staying neutral and he was considering strattera i said i first go with Victor strategy and after will consider that surely, I also told that to Herr Dr Dubach my Psychiatrist its been 1-3 years i noted everything down in my WhatsApp Log where Victor can also read everything just in case for many reasons including having a documentation of what happened and in case something fishy would go on and in case i needed to check how i felt and what i did on "Medicaiton Dosages X and/or Y" and to know what people said back then. *Details end*) against coffee and Herr Eich who recommended to try Strattera Monotherapy try.

[22.09.2023, 18:15:33] Marco Luca Hefti: -afternoon and evenings might have less anxiety could it be because higher levels of 40Eq or because higher ADHD levels and with high Eq levels it cancels out? Dont know just reporting. However it might be kidna similar... But afternoons seem maybe more productive. Late evenings are not 20-22 
Mornings often include anxiety/pressure of work...hm afternoons often have little pressure or none.

[23.09.2023, 15:41:20] Marco Luca Hefti: But apart from being very slow and low drive im pretty much almost normal exept a bit inhibited intuitions somethimes working memory senses. Very minor or in the normal range.
[23.09.2023, 15:42:43] Marco Luca Hefti: Did put the things i bought back almost liked drive in the middle maybe since i did not intake the 40Eq and it might have  created a hole since it usually is active for about 8h (or increasing in levels which might explain the clinical effects when the body would readjust homeostasis.

It is litterally super little money. Also its kinda a impulsive thing most things i do will have longlasting impact i did it more to be nice/social good feel in other person and because i like it. But my voice was a bit strange at one point i mean not perfectly balanced first it was not Nachdrücklich enoguht and the other person started to not listen to what i said in between and then it was a tiny bit too much since i was worried she get hopes up and then be disappointed

-Still i dont like when UPK people seem strangly cool when i did nothing wrong too its the same kinda feel.

-Like Herr Schneider seemed slighty Angry and Herr Ostermeier even seemed to apologize for him i have no fucking idea whats up with braindead experts but one thing is for sure i really need to some day get statements from everyone that everything is great as to not be suprised by something.

Also the politicians that made laws concerning quality control should be touching there heads…

Also police years ago did say they made a report and all happy all good like everyone but then did not send the copy when i asked and then later said “nothing in system” i have it all documented. 

But i guess everything is fine and people are not bumbling baffoons.

Reallz need AI lawyers to keep people in line and prevent bad service or manipulation of systems like it happens in school all the time. Slander is comon but usually easily spottet i guess

[24.09.2023, 12:45:32] Marco Luca Hefti: I even had timers in advance but i did not have the intuitionif how long eating would take and i did not want to go with empty stomage since that would have been worse than not going.

Yeaterday Asier was ~1-1.5 hours in the bathroom but he annonced it so all great. I hope he is fine i always try to super nicely say if i may just go for 1-2 minutes. And i always wait 10-15 minutes before even asking. 👌
[24.09.2023, 12:46:05] Marco Luca Hefti: When i left said good bye he answered with warm voice and normal.
[24.09.2023, 12:51:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Also in kitchen. I guess im just not as sympatic sounding or he just repeatedly did not have much to say.

It is true that my voice does not sound *as* sympathic but it sounds pretty fine i think. Better than most of the time since the 4 years dynamic medication trials ala Victor still. ‎<This message was edited>

Well that is good hiking with mom is already 10x better. Than in the last years.

Usually i come at the correct time exept when im tired or less motivated.
Also when im normal i come late more then if i think it is a rare important Victor meet with limited time for example.
[24.09.2023, 13:10:32] Marco Luca Hefti: This is a typical adhd phenomena i lerned from the most cited adhd scholar.

Also hiking might be not very stimulating and i usually never go to Hörnli to where Granddad lays because im not religious.
[24.09.2023, 13:29:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Mom told me multible different things which usually makes me annoyed but i stayed more calm then usual but not like i could not do that the rest of the time too but i dont feel like its urgent enough not me but my subcontious so i guess what i believe to be the situation (my concepts if ehat is happeing) can elevate the urgency.

Its the typical adhd symthoms reduce in immediately highly salient situations as barkley and pretty much most of the adhd field teaches.

But i guess he was just waiting to say hi. Or looking something up on his phone 😊 ‎<This message was edited>
[24.09.2023, 18:46:13] Marco Luca Hefti: Asier came back seconds after i came home ^^ nice so we could maybe discuss the further cleaning after i do some with thomasz :)
[24.09.2023, 18:46:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Great hike was good to go connect with Family also good for soul and Sport so to say
[24.09.2023, 18:53:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Asked mom some wisdom questions (parents are good at that) 

And what she thinks of Gracie putting Marco 2020 and a rose in her profile suddenly when i think she usually does both have it.

She said strange „joined whatsapp explanation die not seem very intuitive“ but i said i do not believe that but i take her input but i am *not* prepared to make a judgement from that alone and i also said that i would not mind it super much more other things in relation but i just mentioned it quickly like 5 min she also talked about her relationship and what she was contemplating and enjoyed my company a lot it seemed.

I was not perfect obviously but i think pretty nice she wven complimented my behaviour in a few ways

[25.09.2023, 11:41:13] Marco Luca Hefti: This is nothing new and like this for years (exept some of the time mostly corrolating with good motivation/drive/less ADHD/more enjoyment/less discomort or no discomfort):

"I keep taking my left legg up and resst it on a soft peace of pillowhatever on my left Armschairlehne and butting the foot ont he right Oberschänkel. Maybe i need the pressure or strain on the left leg somehow adrenalin adhd or whatever malcoping or selfcoping idk.

When i take both legs down the pressure on my chest core and breth impulse supression increases and is uncomfortable. (to sit upright)

Your leg position might be a way your body seeks grounding or stimulation. ADHD often comes with sensory-seeking behavior.
Sitting upright could feel restrictive due to increased tension or breathing difficulty, which is common for some people."
[25.09.2023, 11:46:11] Marco Luca Hefti: I wonder if people believe me when i say Victor told me since 4 years  (since i meet and knew a bit more personally had spend some time /he started helping me free of charge) that he had 176 Intelligence Quotient. (especially in the beginning but never challenged when i bring it up just wants me to bring it up more rarely or not bring it up which i try to do and so it rarely is topic). Not saying i say that or belive that without question but i was told it and if people tell me things that are so close for so long and so open about all kinds of life (at elast int he first 1-2 year until kinda strong reduction, but still from time to time tells me stuff) then generally im inclined to believe people. Does definitly feel smarter than a lot of people in some way that is absolutetly true. Not making claims tho. Just a entry into my priv. daily journal. :)

[25.09.2023, 17:04:57] Marco Luca Hefti: -Gym
-injured during squat slighty lower spine/ similar to very very mild „Hexenschuss“. But it is not uncommon for them to start slow snd worsen.
[25.09.2023, 17:13:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Guess they are closed and the phone to call them seems to not be picked up. After two time calling.
I thought they are 24/7 walk in or smth slightly more flexible especially on a monday. 

Since it is mild i will let it be and drive home using the already payed for ticket.
[25.09.2023, 17:14:26] Marco Luca Hefti: I am a bit less nicely dressed today.

Still better then during depression similar sideffect weeks on different medications. 😊

[25.09.2023, 20:41:50] Marco Luca Hefti: screen cuts out this is my freetime its rally annoying it is getting back periodically. Artifacts on screen.
[26.09.2023, 10:14:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Random thing from LLM not formated not corrected for grammer:
"[...] psychiatrist for a change over victor after maybe having done 1-3 changes with victor if they make sense (maybe 1-6 months) he also seems to not send me the medication list we tried over the last 4 years i think i asked him 10 -20 times over the last 4 years and he said yes but frist discuss in the last 1-3 months but dont think he will do that. I hope the apotheke has the medications i got from them since they changed there system and did not know sertain things like 4 months ago or something about when i asked victor for med plan and some time after. he aslso asked me 1-4 times if i get meds mostly from the same apotheke."
[26.09.2023, 11:08:06] Marco Luca Hefti: -The reason i somethimes add a lot of context that seems irrelevant to AI models is that they train based on my like/dislike and the conversations are training data. I have come to know that they somethimes use creative/unusual connections. Therefore and because it is easyer somethimes to write stuff out then to contemplate how to write it more concise and because it helps me not be too bored and adds some novelty and for future training runs i do it.

The LM has defintily addapted/became better. I also explored the reenforcement lerning background systems and confirmed that it does have a effect however minor it may be.
[26.09.2023, 11:08:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Also writing in general helps to train muscle memory and is said to be good for the brain. Now written text or typed how big the difference may be that is another question.
[26.09.2023, 11:10:24] Marco Luca Hefti: -I do not choose what interssts me and AI/some very specific games and knowlege and people but absolutely not others who could even be repulsive have been with me since im small. Now when im perfectly tiltrated or my brain suddenly works better i am more in controll and it is more flexibly addapted to my life circumstances. However i cant pick and choose so ill do the best i can with the tools and opportunitys ive been given. And so far i have let other people do a lot and followed advice.
[26.09.2023, 11:10:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Just as a quick "thoughts to virtual paper."
[26.09.2023, 11:48:25] Marco Luca Hefti: -Since hike with mom i was a bit modestly dressed. I have a minimal possibility of a coal and nose is running somethimes especially when yawning /bored i guess.
[26.09.2023, 12:53:51] Marco Luca Hefti: -some lower back pain
-sent job application
-Appointments
-slow (mostly understimulation/boredom and brain turning off somehow but hard to say or very mild very subtle chronic burnout from slightly too high meds overall feeling more capable than recent months and year so would stay rather than change to worse while having to do stuff until income/routine built up )
[26.09.2023, 12:54:11] Marco Luca Hefti: good sing routine seems to improve

[26.09.2023, 16:09:40] Marco Luca Hefti: Meet Dad will send him the application for Job 1+2 when im home. He offere/Vitamin D Jerome Oberwil.

I could not take notes. He told to leave bag in Car but i should have everything.

Good feel. Just gona be interessting how the adhd will do with the job requirements team driving around in Car and work to construct solarpannel roofs /constructionsites.

I dress less well recently.

I forgot to shave and forgot to change the clothes. I think it is because of lower motivation.
[26.09.2023, 16:13:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad asked if i told victor about the idea of transitioning away. Yes i did not overtently but defninitoy for quite a while maybe even years ago a bit and then more  actually years ago but then memory issues and thought saw some progress abd difficulty since noone seemed to want to take me for some reason said they are „full“
[26.09.2023, 16:14:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor told me about the „psychiatrist“ Engpass/not many people also old people and not too much young people coming that i was also told by Herr Dubach after or around the same time i believe. Seems to be common
[26.09.2023, 16:17:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad asked and talked about a bunch. Also asked if i told my Doctor about the victor thing and so on.

Also said not to look at him in a certain way at one point i guess i daydreamed not sure how i looked i guess social intelligence medication related things but overall went good exept phone fell down by mistake.

[26.09.2023, 16:40:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Random ADHD thought:
-The "connect you phone" thing i never really noticed it before the recent months. I also did not notice how fast it appears and disappears usually it stayed longer. Maybe the time is variable. Dont think they use machine lerning to optimize for engagement or other things though however.
[26.09.2023, 16:43:09] Marco Luca Hefti: -Some leisure time before working on sending dad the coverletter/cv things "today or tomorrow he said."
[26.09.2023, 16:48:13] Marco Luca Hefti: -Search engine keeps changing in google chrome to yahoo i guess it is when there is a update needed or something who knows. Somethimes that never happens for months or even a year but don't remember trivial details like that with high certaintly i guess.
[26.09.2023, 17:54:15] Marco Luca Hefti: -i think i switch more between topic when im easily bored it is however also important for planing effitency - So i guess you want a certain balance. And medications often go in waves too much too little too much too little then they narrow down. aka "Einpendeln".

(This would perfectly fit with the lowered drive/motivation or "burn out when for example strattera would be slightly too high or something slightly too low. Or  totally off but used to it. After all when the baseline is lower it goes back down. Hard to say. The fact remains in recent days i have done more work. But its unclear if im just feeling more urgency for some reason or why exactly because i could game and do leisure still. Yes 40 Eq lowers the need for that kind of stimulation.

[26.09.2023, 18:09:57] Marco Luca Hefti: -writing what may seem a bit erratic or victor said using rare words might be a negative sign so those are elevated as well.

I think they corrolate with positive things however so i guess it depends on context victor would say and clarify. 👍
[26.09.2023, 18:26:23] Marco Luca Hefti: -redish ears i noticed in the last 4 years a lot very very common.

Also left and right ear solo reeish means rising or falling very generally accordibg to victor i think 🤔
[26.09.2023, 18:55:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad and me. He has blue i have green eyes in the sun. It is quite a interessting combo his eyes are very clear and have a interessting tone. (Obviously a purely impulsive and abstract entry.)
[26.09.2023, 19:16:20] Marco Luca Hefti: He smiled and was seeming quite well generally thought also very relaxed. Not sure tho he told me the thing about looking before years and years ago i think he does not like eyecontact especially when i Dont look away perfectly/frequently in that moment i was thinking having my eyes looking at his nose approximately i can remember being suprised when he said it but used to it. (happens very rare) maybe 2 times a year or so. People somethimes have problems with eyecontact not all though some very quickly, some late, some not. The perfect intuition of social norms as the perfect amount of time to look/bodypostition/other things is not really mine currently but it absolutely somethimes is. It can even be exeptional just like in childhood in medication trials and without at spesific times that are said to increase intrinsic attetnion many fold or in "flow" which very good clear minded cognition.

It comes in the form of a "feeling" what a person would like. Maybe it is a big source of lack of confidence to talk to woman and people more often since they seem to be very attuned to such things. It almost seems like a instinctual thing which is quite annoying you can Imagine since it is basically like "i Dont like you for something you cant really intuit" or the other way around "i like you because of X" you seem to have no control over.

I guess it has to do with social intuition and the PFC being a social organ i guess? I would say some medication dampen it however i do seem to have it i remember.... so i guess it was a "treat" response or a "you are acting strange be normal be a well dressed son" response. It was not anything out of the usual as to dad voice level i have heared him be more angry about some minor thing.

Felt like i had to add more detail. Because seemingly quick to judgement/out of context judgements are too frequent and in case i need the detail later i guess..
[26.09.2023, 19:24:33] Marco Luca Hefti: I would like to modestly mention that the waiter was slightly beautiful with her Tattoos and special voice. I however was not at all obsessed and thought i am absolutely brutally under**** and have a absolut dreadful love life in terms of both people and meeting people (super low) while having a above average desire to have a lady that is not low luv-drive.

I however would not drop my hon like a psychopath. Only when i feel like she is playing or cheating secretly and not meeting and not caring about my needs then i would also care less about hers. And she has been nasty in the past but its hard to distinguish genuine emotionales and carelessness.

So ja. But it would be hard to be asked and then have to turn down so i would add to contacts but refuse or tell hon. Well i guess honesty is my downfall in terms of pleasure in that regard but i hope there is some karma. Also i hope to maybe be more into work or pursing my goals but so far it did not seem that way. Sucks.
[26.09.2023, 19:27:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Feel like i have to explain every message as if i worrie it is being read eventho this is a save encripted messaging service. Dont know why. I guess i have very little trust in rules when they can be broken or manipulated based on past experience with autority but that was long ago i think a lot of authority was way better int he later parts of my life. Idk... i do overexplain maybe it is some form of venting and reasurance and also because i want to make many logs so i can use language models to crawl them in the future and even long ones might contain information useful to predict something even if not by the traditional means.
[26.09.2023, 19:34:41] Marco Luca Hefti: I guess i also slightly fear Victor M. misusing the logs he has out of context.  He has access to sooooo much information about anything the deepest secrets and all recorded. And he once thretened it halv indirectly. Also he seems extreamly intelligent and somethimes quite "merciless" aka emotionless. Just did research and logs are good and it is said that there are people who Dont feel much remorse. Im sure V is not that it is just in case it does not hurt anyone this chat is private.  But it is only a remote possibility but the last 4 years seem to have brought a lot of things that seem in line with that. And even saying it can be misued by claiming "paranoid" i am not. Im just making logs for many reasons and one is to protect from covert psychopaths which he seems to have a lot of traits off and i write more when i feel like his behaviour makes less sense in a normal way. Or the environment.

I am NOT sayign he is and i am NOT saying anything that is not provable but contingency...
[26.09.2023, 20:13:55] Marco Luca Hefti: -a bit distracted but also feeling less discomfort overall . Still feeling it/cool habd/feet like dad and me always had without meds and most of my life, but i also was in cold while hiking with mom recently.

[27.09.2023, 07:38:52] Marco Luca Hefti: V. told me once i was investigated and updating pc for each antivirus update was seen as "symthomatic/psychotic/paranoid". Also some other stuff about the heavy/fat kid in gym that sits and does not train and the open door in the restaurant with mom that they did not look and looking inside of where the door goes too. Also some other minor psychology things. I was not sure if he was joking/testing/or serious but he seemed serious and did not budge the hole walk in the forest in Münchenstein. Also some other stuff i cant remember but i rembered since i was hiking with mom and that was the same restaurant.
Im sure it is just for the best of me maybe some ADHD medication tiltration thing, i hope. :) ...
[27.09.2023, 07:39:54] Marco Luca Hefti: -Good Morning i could do some things. Waking up was easier. Getting to sleep harder. But it might still be rejuvinating to lay in the dark/moderately soft bed.
[27.09.2023, 07:48:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Never understood how that stuff means anything 😅 but i assume Victor highly intelligent and ADHD med optimized 1 year older than me knows way more. He is very much into pragmatic/benefitial /useful things and seems to be less interessted in philosophy, arts or social systems. I Dont rememeber but i wanned to talk about morality and it was not really getting much traction where as other fileds like psychology/biology/technology/sport/personal storries and so on did even also non applicable stuff like dating etc did. But it is a long time ago ~2-3 years since we talked a LOT until it kinda quickly seemed to become much less. Like a switch. I enjoyed the walks/talks really smart schweigsam talk partner never had someone seemingly get very complex topics this quick then again somethimes hard to know if someone just stays silent and understands.

Yesterday night bad dream/nervous while going to sleep
But short and no impact on me emotionally just a bit overworriing for a few seconds i think ☺️
[27.09.2023, 12:42:08] Marco Luca Hefti: Frau Bendel said „maybe they overheared you say something“ when i was telling her how people would try to misuse authority to get back at me when they felt i said/did/felt smth. bad  eventho i could not think of what that could be when she asked me what the „standout“ things in terms of trauma or happenings of my past where.

I also said my moms smile when i was young that i seem to remember for a long time and that has much „memerability“.
Also i told her about maybe sex things happened to me that i did not mind and high drive to get girlfriend that is high libido but also very shy so those „opposites“ she asked a lot of adhd symthoms which i answered while it was a bit challenging to be as pregnant and significant as i wanted to be.

I honestly told her a bunch of things she asked for in childhood and the people who hit my stomage from seemingly no reason. Also from increased and decreased Sympathie when meds are perfect making it very easy to hold onto friends and enjoy them and in the opposite way how hard it is to sound behave and intuit that „sympathy“ i also told her about my empistemic love of humans even those that are disabled or have broken the law or are otherwise not liked (it does not mean i love them it is about humility from the complexity and seemingly unfairness of neuropsychological determinism.

She asked s bunch more and i answered a bunch more. She made notes.

She seemed very friendly and smiled lits warm eyes and also smiled big when shaking my hand to leave. I think i made a good impression eventho i was probably hard to get the info out of she decired but not nessesarily.
[27.09.2023, 12:43:13] Marco Luca Hefti: She wanted a Herr Dubach Markus „Schweigepflichtsentbibdubg“ i gave it and made a ommisison error in the date

[27.09.2023, 12:51:55] Marco Luca Hefti: Well its sunny so i should be fine but i will go spontantious visit manor after second 40 Equasim then

[27.09.2023, 12:55:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Denn kann i au grad no de Lebenslauf usdrucke
[27.09.2023, 13:01:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Dont write everything but woman asked me in french. A lot of people seem to ask me smth in french my french is bad. But somethimes it is better i guess also infoueneced howe well i can remember the words and such.
[27.09.2023, 13:17:11] Marco Luca Hefti: I am in a waaay better mood now with what seemed like pigen poop or dirt water than on wrong adhd meds or at many points in the last 7-8 years or in general.

That shows how its is not about the outside things but how much neuromodulators/medications can make a difference even when they seem imperfect/bad and my cognition is halved.

*To be fair it could also be great and just needs way more time to be effective/start working.*
Maybe the worries are a big ploy to help me in some way 😂✨ (I am not saying there is anything im just not sure. Or ja. I am humble i can always be weong in fact i am very very converned about my internal consistancy.

But that is nothing new since i grew up i have payed close attention to internal biases.

Im always willing to talk about *anything* even if it seems ridiculous and needs looooots of time. I like to argue or think/contemplate/debatte/scientifically figure stuff out.
I also love riddles it just has to be a certain way im interessted so not smth boring idk…

I love to talk to the best AI LM‘s for that reason they are like a ever patient/logical/kind/caring/smart/knowledgable tutor. Not to say that they are correct always of course not.

But somehow my attention is keept there… idk maybe past good experiences and intellectually stimulating conversations. Ask the subcontiou parts of my brain/adhd why. I would rather my brain was more aligned with my goals and brilliant like it can be. And not a deactivated mush.

I really wanna experiment with coffee but i cant during the medication trials since victor said so.

I will ask if i can try some after some more job applications and urgend stuff has been done.

[27.09.2023, 13:31:17] Marco Luca Hefti: dryed poop that does not stink does not threated me much but i put on another tshirt  i washed off most at the fountain that made skinconntact tho so the only stuff should be on the shirt i can wash later. Im going to shower but bathroom occupied..
[27.09.2023, 13:32:05] Marco Luca Hefti: One of those days im going to make a Flücktigkeitsfehler/ommisionerror and something is out of context when i listen back to the logs later it might sound strange.
[27.09.2023, 13:32:10] Marco Luca Hefti: /out of context
[27.09.2023, 13:52:43] Marco Luca Hefti: i may have forgot dad mentioned something about being "aktionär" at a company and if i work there it might be bad legaly if i get partial wage payed by RAV (IF that is the case) so i did not write it into the Chat accessable to other people like Victor Management eventho it should make no difference since he is a philantropic honest medical peer who has "patientenschweigegeheimnis" he reminded me just recently. Still why tell also i have to make sure to check if that is a problem and keep that in mind because if i forget i can get into legal truble with RAV because eventho it is probably better that i work then not it probably is tecnically a thing people can filet you over. And for some reason i somethimes feel like people love to know stuff to have leverage or such. But not all just some people. But maybe im just having a trust issue becuase in the past people used authority (like teachers and police) to try to get me implicated in stuff by lying (when they knew of biases or knew i had done X and XY sounded similar and they knew they would believe it much much more readily) also the dude that got me arrested in class for threat suspition with teacher "give Marco French mark XYZ or we do bad thing P" and then it came out that they did it (the two people who seemed to take offence of me debatting or questioning some stuff i did not even say they where wrong i just debatted i had 0 hate or bad intentions for them. But they fucked up because the teacher could hear it was his voice not mine. And obviously it was very shit for my reputation and the stupidest thing anyone ever did. Even the people in 1. class where smarter to make something so obvious. Also there was a lady that had a friend (heavy) she seduced or did stuff then friend sicne i was nice i did then she disappeard quickly and told on us. She even said to stay int he open and i thought that is a stuid/strange idea. And autoritys believed her becuase they are dumb as shit. Honestly we need a surveilance state better than this lying trash of idiots being manipulated by fucked up people with too much motivation but no morals. There definitly is no justice because if there was justice i had endless motivation and people that did such things for no good reason (the good reasons are  still stupid as fuck but at least it is understandable on some level).

I realized that today talking to Frau Bandle since she mentioned that things in history might have a psychological impact. But it could also be that because i have ADHD im a target. Since mental health people according to research are a prime target just as disabled people are as victor recently told me when he talked about that "paraplegic" organisation or whatever. And I 100% agreed.
[27.09.2023, 14:04:04] Marco Luca Hefti: All this lose-win costs so much effort if everyone was just doing win-win then we would all be 3 times richer and work 3 times less and have AI assistants already.

Maybe people are figuring out stuff and helping or just idk... I always concidered that i might just be imagining something. But usually i am ultra mega super mega rarely proven wrong and i am EAGER to find out im wrong. I CELEBRATE when people debatte me or show me with sound logic/reason/patient discussion where i could be /am wrong. So i can be right and improve. I guess because i did that a lot it is now harder to find such things. But im always open and im not angry at critisism i actually i think it is kind of a person to try to help you by showing you where you might be able to improve. :)

So im in a positive mindset relaxed and i do more work recently so ja. But I still make this logs here just in case and because writing is good and because memory and because medication and because language model data and because bringing thoughts to paper and because of other benefits and epistemic humility and gehorsam to follow some peoples adivce and to try to do stuff what i can and not do nothing.

Right now the last two messages might be a bit long but complex stuff is hard to put concise and ja. Somethimes my strength is to be concise somethimes im too concise somethimes im too little consise... ❤ Im trying. Also everyone should benefit i do not leave out anyone even people who seem to be opposite of me believe differently or even did some stuff because it is win-win to think "if im good to everyone whenever possible without twisting myself unresonably" then why not do it? But idk. Some people might then think im a target because im "too nice" but i really am just taking easy opportunitys when they arrive it is just effitient and also some karma ideas. Some biology karma ideas. Im agnositc/not very religious at all but also Dont have anything against religious people and would protect them if it came down to it BUT that would also be covered it is just easyer to be good than do the insanely hard work of tring to pirate.

But i guess that keeps systems healthy when they are tested so ja, and some DNA might have no other good strategy so they might be forced so that is why i am very very non judgemental. I mean i can judge i can definitly do that but the question is it advancing things or just unnessesary effortful/expensive hate? Anyway. Thoughts writen down. Reasons complex. Takign shower bathroom should be free.
[27.09.2023, 15:28:44] Marco Luca Hefti: -I still have to do the coverletter and employement thing for the company dad recommended so i might have to put spontanious employment on tomorrow not sure if more important.
[27.09.2023, 16:00:36] Marco Luca Hefti: -called mom. She asked if dad had planed stuff because of "Ausflug 3-5 November she would have liked to do with me (and i would like to now spend a bit more time with family /mom since i always wanted to do it but i had low drive/enjoyment and if you Dont have at least a bit of enjoyment/dystimia/anhedonia it is not very pleasuable for other people so i seems from when i was more depressed. But it depends if you just "think" you Dont enjoy or you really feel discomfort and *cant* enjoy much/at all/depri too much. 

It is quite hard so that is why progress in that area is needed and why i think it is urgent to push those developments carefully but rather sooner than later.
[27.09.2023, 18:41:38] Marco Luca Hefti: -The website "ProSolis AG in Arlesheim, Julien Arzner" seems to be only 1 page with a email and a telefonnumber and picture. dad gave me the adress now applying
[27.09.2023, 18:43:31] Marco Luca Hefti: -When it comes to 40 Equasim it might be that: "i seem, to not feel that i need breaks and also no hunger"  but im not sure
[27.09.2023, 19:53:14] Marco Luca Hefti: -keep getting distracted of thoughts i guess the discomfort is the natural state when you force yourself to concentrate when it is very hard.  (Somethimes of easily manipulated police/psychiatrist and noone beliving me and idiots that are selfasured and wrong.)

but trying to work. Also the anxiety and discomoft is also making focusing way harder.
[27.09.2023, 20:31:18] Marco Luca Hefti: sent email to dad with coverletter. Life is shit i do nothign but write CVs this medication trash is terrible I WANT A REAL PSYCHIATRIST AND A LAWYER if nessesary but im too low drive i am struggling so im counting on other people
[27.09.2023, 20:49:50] Marco Luca Hefti: -discomfort inducing things:
"working on cv and applying for work. Also forms and paperwork in general or planning travels or such. Also working on to do lists or doing the steps nessesary for management websties and such i think also coding or reading instruction manuals also cleaning, gym"
[27.09.2023, 21:47:14] Marco Luca Hefti: -barely feel the Hexenschuss thing it was definitly felt and still is to some extent but really not much

[28.09.2023, 10:29:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Frau Meyer the young asisstant that works at the pharmacy since ~ 6 monts-1 year told me they only let Equasim/Medications come the next day new rule eventho since 4 years it was the rule that if you order something (or vent Vitamin D) then it would come in the afternoon if you ordered it in the morning.

Herr Theobald the new Chief Doctor of the pharmacy since the old one retired/etc tole her „No No We have not discussed that“ or something like that phrace.

Frau Meyr the new person i was talking about asked me when exactly i would get it today or tomorrow morning. I said i am not sure yet.

Also that it will be there in the afternoon and i can pick it up around ~16:00

She asked if it was „urgent“ i said well not particularly (however due to the slow rate at which perscriptions are given out it would be good to get it early.)

She informed me that the perscription has still not arrived but Herr Magnenat Victor is in discussion with the UPK and called at the 20.9.2023

I thought we discussed this weeks ago.

All in all this quick daily journal.

[28.09.2023, 18:28:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Random ADHD thought: If i suddenly Dont get 40 Equasim twice a day anymore could this mean i cant form Memorys since for a certain period the 30 Strattera + 0mg Equasim will make memory consolidation obsolete  and in this period some stuff can happen until the body adjusts? or will it have to coincide with the strattera also being dropped suddenly? I told Victor .M. that people remember sertain things depening on what dosages they where for example coffee or other things so the "brainstate" kinda seems to also remind the brain of what Memorys it lerned/consolidated at that time so to say. Did this also happen last time i tryed to get work and most of all get a psychiatrist? And then stuff like psychosis, pedo or paranoid is used so people disbelieve the person stuggling with even speaking clearly and dressing well while ADHD symthoms come back fulll force and the honest hero that studyes Doctor Title that found his medication dosage earlyer is believed by virtue of the "helo effect"? I hope not. :) Surely authoritys could not be this easily manipulated by a high iq dude that has exeptional intelligence and a few years of prep.
[28.09.2023, 18:30:41] Marco Luca Hefti: going to check on motorcycle i worked my ass off today again 0 freetime becuase i think autoritys have 0 brain to be save aka im kinda fucked since im low drive i cant easily do al the stuff nessesary like lawyer or get all the documents or whatever to make sure it is clear that im doing everythign correctly

[28.09.2023, 20:52:26] Marco Luca Hefti: I greeted Thomasz wenn i came back ~30min ago. A nice evening i die take a walk and stay a bit in nature to recharge from the mentally straining work/RAV/Paperwork day.
[28.09.2023, 20:53:41] Marco Luca Hefti: I told Victor many times over the years that i would like to try a real psychiatrist some time. So i friendly asked to meet or talk since he was not able to meet last time.

All good just always a „struggle with the medication“
[28.09.2023, 20:54:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Because the perscriptions always come too late and it is stressfull since this hole on and off medication thing is stressfull.
[28.09.2023, 21:08:31] Marco Luca Hefti: I am feeling super normal. I also feel like some things i expereienced before like i was at RAV before and it seems to be the same thing as last time/times by coincidence. I am feeling left alone i feel like people are not really talking me serioulsy and i have those worries i had since 4 years somethimes less somethimes a bit more that are toally controled and very rationally calm, that victor tells people im crazy or paranoid or whatever and then keeps me in control. And i fear that saying it sounds crazy so i try not to only very very small and rare but i hope people talke me seriously im in such a vulnerable Position with the medication i might lose memory when im not on them. 21:08

[29.09.2023, 11:33:17] Marco Luca Hefti: -i have decided to vulunteer because eventho i believe i am decerving of way more than i get in terms of psychological and emotional intelligence if there is some sort of karma i do recognice that it might not be apparent of because i strive for big advancements i never balance it out with contentment with less /modesty and with a open mind do something i feel like is less impact and i somethimes feel like it is for "looks" rather than impact but i do not beleive that currently since life seems so complex.
Loong storry short i i will vulunteer like a sport club regularily and i will maybe later think of a sport club. I am flexible really... Also i feel like the employment process seems to take off in the recent days i have been able to do a lot.
[29.09.2023, 12:44:58] Marco Luca Hefti: -eventhough im less impaired than on other dosages, especially the employment stuff has  been really good in the last 3 days.
[29.09.2023, 12:47:55] Marco Luca Hefti: I still seem to come late a lot variability in speed seems very apparent.

I cant say what i suspect since it might sound para./psyc./cra.

[29.09.2023, 12:51:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Still early enought it seems. I wonder if it is that building victor walked me too once and we visited the insides since he wanted zo buy food/drink

This is why the state needs to have compensation i guess. Orherwise people can just use the delay or investigation to fuck a person over while they have a great life on the side.
[29.09.2023, 13:03:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Arrived on time about 5 min early. But ja i can be 10000000x more organised im like partially disabled. In some ways. Like mental health is such a riskfaktor and there needs to be idk… follow what they do im sure things will be bad probably for week people also more physical idk….

[29.09.2023, 14:26:22] Marco Luca Hefti: Er hed bestätigt das i nid paranuid/psychotisch/usw bi und wo i erwähnt ha ka das er im Wald erwähnt hed ka das Pedop. Investigatione bi mit am laufe sind (ohni sich z wiederhole und nid sicher ob toternste Witz mit dehr viel usduhr wo er nid ufglöst hed delbst nach mehrfacher Nochfrog ich erinnere mi no an details was er gseit hed ka)
Do hed er reagiert als wär nüt und „Hää?! Was?? Nei!!“ Stiel.
[29.09.2023, 14:29:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Müesst d Treffe eigentlich wirklich ufnäh. Aber me hört denn doch fast nüt wenn me s nid im Hosesack hed und er hed s verbotte/nid welle und ka… Ich hoff das es andereitig abhört würd aber glaub eher nid.
Eventuell sind d „sorge vor Investigation nur glegt worde damit ich mich vor Schatte verteidige versuech also mit Ängst spiele.
[29.09.2023, 14:33:10] Marco Luca Hefti: But it is strange what happened in the last 4 years for absolute sure there definitly was something.

But while my meds are not adjusted im very careful what i think is true my brain is very slow and im vulnerable it seems.
[29.09.2023, 14:33:43] Marco Luca Hefti: He said he had 120 patients until now and most he puts on the right meds in 4-5 Months
Only some take long.
[29.09.2023, 14:44:18] Marco Luca Hefti: He talked like someone that knows he is lying at many points where he had truble speaking like someone that was called out. 

Or is super unsure what he says but then he talked super normal - it was towards the beginning. If any of what i said or suspected lets say some very low basyen probability.(Pablo called) It is unlucky because because it was exactly 14:05 that is the time where equasim is lowest and during those 30 minutes i somethimes lose working memory of what i heared before i can write it down).
[29.09.2023, 14:54:25] Marco Luca Hefti: It is like talking to a (selfpeoportef 167 iq individual (he corrected me once at leadt when i sayd my (83iq tested when i came down of meds and could barely talk. Victor sent me to UPK to get tested and i remember the woman not writing those things into the IQ test prelog and me complaining (i think email and i told Herr Dold) was not corrected) - that his iq was twice as high as mine and he said no not twice more than twice as high „83+83 = 166 ahh yes right 16*7* jesus christ!😮“ so clearly it was not just 1 time.

So anyway imagine that + perfect machine lerned tiltrated medicated genius vs a person that is heavily medically impaired. Bot because i think i cant be exceptional (i had experiences many many where my brain was breathtaking) anyway.

Point is its like a chess world master playing against a person who is sleep deprived, impaired (hypothetically systematically)

But im not saying it is that way of course not.

That is why i always write that those logs are containing a lot of contingency protocol.
[29.09.2023, 14:57:47] Marco Luca Hefti: Might also be a philantrophist and bad luck and lots of coincidences and medication but all to the maximum since there where things even those could not explain in  totall.
Luckely i never make premature judgements about persons and even if i do i have a insane level of perspective and „lets think forwardness“

But it might be that my slow system 2 brain 🧠 that is imprecice but processes a lot of undtructured info is very very active and my precise but liniar brain is not having ad much badwith allocated to it my neuromodulators for example.

Deep work talks about it or other books like thinking fast and slow.
[29.09.2023, 14:58:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Deep work said it best 2. is like gogle data centers that crunch lots of unstructured data and 1. like a home computer that does what you want reliably and no variability.
[29.09.2023, 14:58:53] Marco Luca Hefti: Just a hypothesis..
[29.09.2023, 15:01:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Ok enought contingency it is tiring my brain feels like it has weights attached to it thinking slow.

Victor changes the „best dose“ prediction all the time it seems. It does not feel genuine but it might be that he has very short memory but i do not believe so.

Well it might also be language model context memory since he said something about those but i do not even know if he uses those systems because since the first 2 years he almost never talks about private things anymore.
[29.09.2023, 15:12:25] Marco Luca Hefti: Exept that his mom is suposidly or was hyperreligious i guess but i cant confirm that but i take everything he sais with a grain of salt the longer things last and the more things seem to not add up.

He did not smile much or at all. I tried to be friendly and because my brain is so forgetful i could litterally smile however i could smile when i was tortured by meds for a month and meet him i guess it is the epistemic humility and the deep down thought it is all just coincidence it cant be it would be too elaborate.

I reserve judgement but also because i deal with so much „absuse“ in school my friends where always betraying or taking advabtague or lying about o some extent i lerned to take people overall and not for there faults because 1) i would have it much harder and be even more vulnerable
2) I wanted to be a person that can forgive because i know how biology can be the opposite of what you intend/want so i did realize how hard it can be and have compassion.
3) i believe when im like this one day Karma or some biological righteousness will realize im win/win good and efficient human to have around and i will have the advantagues of psychological gifts (it is complex but basically simple resoning from 1. principles and/evolutionary biology)

Also you gotta have something or you gonna go insane/depressed/bitter/hateful and i wanned to be dude that stays good mood and by that does not waste time on battles he cant win or  immoral/bad strategies.

Also because when ur the underdog you gotta take it or u get even more hate.

I guess people in lower classes also have it hard and take out hate on others.

There is lots of good and its about glass halv full or halv empty and felling depression does make things only worse so i dont see why suffer unnecessary if there is no return for it.
[29.09.2023, 15:13:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Okay enought of that. But maybe the language models can guess some stuff from more thorrow explanations and ideas and its saver to have more detail since i may not know what would become relevant and i dont want to forget a crutial detail.
[29.09.2023, 15:14:25] Marco Luca Hefti: But i also think it might look strange to write this much but in a situation like mine i dont want to take chances

Better more than less i guess
[29.09.2023, 15:33:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Vorbehug bekommen
[29.09.2023, 15:38:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Treffen war doch wo anders das Treffen welches ich im Kopf hatte war beim Botanischen Garten glaube ich. Nicht sicher. Gut

Spotanbewerbungen wären auch gut
[29.09.2023, 15:38:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Zu viel protokuliert für dieses Treffen
[29.09.2023, 15:47:52] Marco Luca Hefti: I wanned to give Victor water and food but he refuses most time anyway and it might seem like i think he is innocent because people would not understand that im really serious about i am mega mega hard to convince since it would be so „unglaublich“ „insane“ to believe it eventho the evidence seems quite heavy to seriously investigate.

And my brain cant remember all things so i also cant remeber why i would be mad in vivid detail and just that there seems to be massive amounts of things that seem lore than fishy like super fishy… and i also do not want to seem crazy when im not so i just have bo afvantague to not act normal, and since i dont know if people believe me or what is involved here or not the stockholmsyndrom goes on uncontiously with me where i forget the negatives and even say things against my selfinteresst to be on the good side since you never know when ur free so no matther where you are you just play it save and just assume the best or that everythingbis fine otherwise ur seen as a threat.

I also am not interessted in risky and (for me) useless punishments or such i am just wanting to find my meds and be save.

Also i dont feel hate/anger for some reason i think on some medications of when im more normal i might get controllably angry which is useful but when ur never sure people are on ur side u kind give up and give in preventively because u dont want to be punished or want calm
[29.09.2023, 15:48:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Its like the guy from game of thrones that is held and when he escapes with the help of X  or made to believe he can disobey and run it was a trick
[29.09.2023, 15:53:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Not saying that is me because many reasons including that im not saying it is but im saying there is enought to be careful and that i want a Psychiatrist like i said many times in the kast years and people dont help searching or the psychiatrists say no. 
And i cant say suspitions or they thing im paranoid and hard to deal with or smth.

Bad system in my opinion there should be some neutral instance that is incorruptable and where you can check your concerns especially if ur vulnerable to things like reputation attacks and such.

Physical threats are easy but these things are a threat since noone would believe you or just check the subsurface.

I feel like overexplaining in case anyone reads this leading to me wiritng a lot maybe also just to feel like i noted it and it cant be used easily anymore. Or if there where signs someone would monitor the chat somehow which i hope. (Someone neutral better multible and not somone in any way involved here.)
[29.09.2023, 15:55:50] Marco Luca Hefti: I wanna say thank you because it is decent but dont want to give impression everything is fine as well. Ill just thank normaly… i mean cant control all scenarios… so i really beed to stop. I think because i wrote while EQ kicked in now i wrote more then i wanted bot sure. 😅 ‎<This message was edited>

[29.09.2023, 18:39:59] Marco Luca Hefti: V. told me today that he is friends with a friend of Dr Schneider or dr Schneider (cant remember, dr Schneider seemed to kinda offer me a ZZP and also did speak against the "constelation Marco/victor aka" "Es ist mir unwohl dabei" he also seems slightly angry at me and i Dont know why. He also said he meet Victor last time i meet him. I think i meet him for the 2. or not much more time. I told victor of the meet in advance. Herr Schneider told me of him coincidently meeting V before the meet. I have wrote that into the log before. I have no bad feelings towards Herr Schneider im slightly confused off the seeming tension for seemingly no reason between us. Also the medication change right before the meet might have not been good but not sure i did not feel too bad. I think i meet Herr Schneider a long long time ago too.
[29.09.2023, 18:47:13] Marco Luca Hefti: heared Thomasz empty the dishwasher so i emptyed it too - initiated mini smalltalk

[29.09.2023, 19:05:03] Marco Luca Hefti: -Since 3 days i work a lot almost every day way more than before and V wanned to change the medication tomorrow. Also asked in 1 week? No mention of RAV. That means nothing but it is a Korrelation that i keep an eye out.... eventho my memory is delivered by snails inside fog.
[29.09.2023, 19:27:13] Marco Luca Hefti: RAV stuff - basically barely or no freetime since 4 days hope i dont burn out.

Luckely i have way better time with barely/no anxiety and i can focus slowly and a bit inneffitient but almost all day at least i am on it all day. I Dont think i have done anything wrong but somehow i am happy for this urgency somehow it is not decapacitating but almost helps

[29.09.2023, 22:48:43] Marco Luca Hefti: :)
[29.09.2023, 22:49:55] Marco Luca Hefti: It was not anything crazy just not really taking care after even nicely asking to turn tv volume a tiny bit down.

When im with my gf i try to be quiet. She also always mentioned that.
[29.09.2023, 22:50:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Exercising negative thougts to have a mesitative emty mind.
[30.09.2023, 07:49:41] Marco Luca Hefti: woke up like always good sleep eventho some noise in the evening.

paperwork/gym really motivated just wish i was more confident in institutions so i would balance leisure / work time a bit better which i would love to do.
[30.09.2023, 07:51:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Towel smelled good and i did not use it too much but since it is a while i replaced it just to fit the norm i guess. Eventho i have other prioritys right now.

I gave the playlist to family, elie Victor, Rebecca, brothers maybe maybe not.

I guess if the videos get reported they may be taken down. I guess i should make sure not to give the music playlist link away because if they are widely known maybe some are idk….

Most sobgs should be official anyway i mean more the sidewongs of dubstep and remixes those are amazing.

Obviously noone would do that contiously that would be obsessional or no 0 chance😂

Makes me smile inside and ja funny 😆 no way this would be real 0% probablility haha

But heared it a bit just in case making log eventho thought is like ja at that point you can worrie about traffic statistic when you drive 😄
[30.09.2023, 10:45:28] Marco Luca Hefti: -random talking point:

I am bjoy like. 700 songs litterallly all genres.

Also i looked a second too long at a dude because he had  mild sililaritys with a internet celebrity but then not really. But since im slow im usually less subtle and it may seem like i pay more attention then i am.

V is well aware knows all ins and outs more than eveb my family since they did not talk so much with me somethimes

(Dont wanna write too positive in other chat for worries meds might get changed) (not saying that is the case but coincidence and such. Altho i will just not all the time and careful not to exxaggerate also wanna be concise)
[30.09.2023, 11:02:22] Marco Luca Hefti: AI told me to look 20 meters every 20 minutes into distance for eye health and see how it goes since a while but i might inadvertantly seem like looking at people and my curious mind might

[30.09.2023, 11:37:23] Marco Luca Hefti: Glad i did not get the cold. Sniff a bit but i also do that without meds. Also cuffing when i want clarity or centeribg myself or yawhn when it feels good also.

However more the cuff.

Brothers can attest to that also all my family. But ive been cuffing almost never/never on some med dosages or maybe it has to do with stress it may also not happen without maybe it is related to airmoisture and predictable idk. Havent set up the machine lerning corrolating stuff yet eventho its very simple if i had attention/brain/e.f.
[30.09.2023, 12:07:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Thought i saw mia but dont think so

[30.09.2023, 13:57:18] Marco Luca Hefti: and stuff like that about rent and krankenkasse and when i get "Lohn" i gotta do it myself and also get more money from people a bit since my price might be too far or nice (not sure if it still perfectly 1:1 Respons to Squarefeet of the house.

[30.09.2023, 14:05:14] Marco Luca Hefti: My voice control is really not the worst also not the best. I sound kinda sympathic althoug a bit meh but good things. 40 Eqasim is really suprisingly better after a strange start to it also barely anxiety or no anxiety maybe since victormeet or maybe since i could do some work or once i got "into doing work" while int he beginning there seemed to be 0 difference and it did not seem to nudge however i felt it getting better overall. But it was maybe a non liniar increase. (nothing new many things can happen when adjusting meds depending on a bunch of factors i hope Machine Lerning capabilitys of LLM's are soon better - actually i think it would be more about persistance of context memory and not even about the capabilitys. 

Somethimes i write trivial things or hobbie things just so i show not only the "contingency" and "special" savetyjournalentrys/medication entrys. So i can later check what a medication dosage was like when i have more motivation/cognition/my brain works halv decently or if it really would be nessesary. It also would help with legal stuff or just in general. Also for LLM corrolations automatized and analyzed with various ML methods (but that would be when my brain really works and i did a lot of responsibilitys and other stuff and wanned to maximize my productivity/other positive metrics)
[30.09.2023, 14:07:08] Marco Luca Hefti: I was jsut about to get the food in the oven by ignoring my timer until i wrote til the end and then someone i Dont know send a WhatsApp text. I would be in danger of forgetting the food and letting it burn this is a thing on all dossages/the bad ones but on the good ones or when i am keeping an eye on it or when im just lucky it is not. Currently my working memory is quite normal/good. Quite good compared to last 4 years most of the time honestly. :)

[30.09.2023, 14:18:13] Marco Luca Hefti: I just went room and Thomasz girlfriend was there it is awkward because if i feel like a guy is uncomfortable if i speak or interact with gf i try to not pay attention but really hard to not pay attention if im not allowed to. Also its super easy to not look and i an 0% aroused but i somethimes get awkward when i inhibit impulse (curiosits rather than attraction believe it or not)
(I did have attraction for gf before for sure like Jans but she was just really cute and not always just like 10% of the time i think she was somethimes a bit into me when i was super fit or really on top of my game (medications) of course i always wrote everything i to the log victor had access to so those medication/special relationship timings should have been well documented for the medication tiltration. :)
[30.09.2023, 14:23:59] Marco Luca Hefti: So my voice is also kinda strange when i say hi to someone i feel might be prejudgemebtal of me because they saw me when meds where bad or when i was not optimally dressed or something. Also when i feel like im being tested. Or just by chance. The beighbour that stood there and i said hi and he did not say anything back at that time my voice was super mega mega strange and i can assure i feel 0% attraction as well xD

At least i could see a universe where if date a woman if she was legal age and super perfect character and i was single but i would obvioulsy not date a guy since im not gay.

I on 1 medication rollercosster thought i feel a shadow of „bi“ but honestly may just been stockholmS. + being mega mega mega underfucked and wannting to express „im a poor soulf victor dont be lazy and find my adhd meds already so i can be normal confidence and have 5000%  more dating success or motivation/desire to do the nessesary hard things ladys want (which are super easy and pleasurable with the right meds i felt it before super easy, feel like i could be beeing played with like a experiment honestly) even to beginn with.
[30.09.2023, 14:25:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Just feels that way somethimes super rarely obviously we all know feelings mean nothing since we might feel attracted to a hammburger but know its not health. Normal people might bot relate since the brain changes what is nice with the right meds based on your goals/needs it is almost like the PFC would influence or talk to the amigdala based on spesific timings. Based on what ive seen from researching some adhd

[30.09.2023, 14:41:11] Marco Luca Hefti: The channel „adhd science“ has amazing videos from russel barkley (the playlist about emotions and executive functioning)

The youtube or russel barkley is a trap the good stuff is interlacent with not very informative videos.

However it is still great for lovers of barkleys beilliant argumentations and videos

(By the way barkely is not at all perfect just way better in my opinion brilliant - but still biases abd misunderstanding/interpretation some of the time. But noone is perfect or maybe that aparent imperfection is the thing making it all perfect.

Which is a bice thought

[30.09.2023, 14:48:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Rare that im getting so much attention from family. Once i was more motivated and die stuff it came back i guess also the forms and employment stuff i guess that is normal when im more motivated i like this / direction
[30.09.2023, 14:49:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Not the attention but that stuff is happening and i am not in great discomfort and some minimal mild drive in the background or enjoying things like gym shower. Sitting down somethimes when its comfy and i have been up. I guess more the absence of ridicoulus discomfort.

My gigantic AI assisted (credits to the « shoulders of gigants ») brain just cane up with a sweeet sweeeeeeeet sweeeeeeeeeeet hypothesis oh man. Or *

Category:
Youtube jucy Armchairhypoqthesis:
Adhd:

[Subcontious google datacenter /unstructured data with imprecise but continually optimising for all variables non temporaly bound or just by lifetime - M.L.]

Then a part that is activated under threat fight or flight (lever to go back to non immediately beneficial brain processing 🧠 deactivates or the threshold of when it is activated is higher than the treat the evolutionary organism (human) is actually in.
Therefore i guess in trauma the optimal efficient parts may not be engaged enought. (Stuck fight or flight.)
[directive PFC / maybe cerebellum / basal ganglia] (just the phd R.B. pathway theory]

Simple version:

ADHD implicated parts temporaly constrain and it might be called « thinking (also context selection and limitation included that would be like temporary finetuning (LORA? Not sure), probably, by the way…)

So basically:

Brain might not or too greedily constrain or non context time specific therefore « temporal myopia adhd comments »
  
Hm.


Oh wooooww so maybe when you go walk and distances change it might have to do with why that might influence your brain just like deep work talked about darwins walking paths.

Cool 💡


I had this idea before and i made the comment before i think this comment section or somewhere else.

I am not saying this comment is written coherently or inside the box it is a bit abstract. Also it was funny to write it in this way i guess or it helped with paying attention. ‎<This message was edited>

„Nice video. I like the concept   X, it was well said.“, „Interessting.“ etc.
[30.09.2023, 16:18:08] Marco Luca Hefti: -my brain works better in some aspects.
[30.09.2023, 22:24:20] Marco Luca Hefti: People keep making noise or writing me when i want to sleep and not before eventho im forced wake up every day at 6:30 because od strattera.

Unlucky :( will hamper my efforts to find work
[01.10.2023, 00:43:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Still awake unlucky.
[01.10.2023, 02:26:17] Marco Luca Hefti: I am having memorys come up when i was walking with Victor in the forest. Then he asked me to stop suddenly when i had the inuitions of them shortly after briefly describing them while mentally trying to view them.

Not sure if he was mad before then or if he was the guy who felt betrayed or in his pride hurt when a woman (beuatiful) (only super rare woman in FHNW like 95% Man) came next to me in elevator and talked.

I was bored looking at her then some situation with a group on 1 side and me on the orher side where they stared at me and i stared dawn having realized i had bored watched her (med was low was discomfort from adhd and had low motivation/mentalfuel/selfmotivationressozrce/selfcontrol over my feelings and motivations

Then he approached he seemed kinda angry but also like a person that was super intelligent or confident.

I intuited it was that (because i asked the other lady if she wanned to study after she came stand next to me and speak to me in elevater feom vig presentation Saal/Hall then she said no whatsapp i asked email or anything? She said no she does not have. I thought she is not honest with me also medication was low (i was taking amp short release whenever needed but also SSRI so i gave up and thought she might just be trying to get me reported for looking at her and playing nice until she knows where i study or some ploy. So i was not sure and thought „i lost the smoothness i had back then when i felt eyactly what to do and hat the emotions to be funny and the bodyposture (hard to describe its like you just know what to do) (mebtal gps/intuition Russel Barkley phd calls it i think) seems to happen uncontiously but you can choose what goals to follow it is awesome. (Or normal but awesome for someone with adhd i guess)

Anyway…. So i was working with my group and i felt im having trouble being sympatic and when he cane as well presumingly to blame or tell me smth while probably wanting to not look at his gf (i had a dude come to me in school i was looking at his gf and he showed me sickpack and seemed like wanting me to apologize eventho not illegal. But ja. Some dude kidnapped a lady that was with me when i was in 1 class just dragged her on hand over claraplatz noone did anything noone called police when i asked to call and said what happens.

So something seems to trigger peoples „This dude is not allowed to have any gf“ or „dont like this human“ but hard to say maybe it is normal that such thibgs happen but with some meds suddenly people seemed to be like magically changing it is strange like they are controlled by instinct or subcontious something.

Well so ja i felt like asking him „something wrong here im depressed abd struggle in life family does not act maybe they gave me some drugs for some reson maybe because i liked a older woman that had made out with me when i was younger (like 18-20-25 dont know) then she disappeared dont know whT they did i was pissed did not want her imprisoned and i think the Champiere teacher said she is not i was still worried but relieved then i was still into woman maybe they gave me some drug to take what they preceived as „problematic memory or sexdrice“ away but i thought if it is legal i have a right and the slightly too old lady (law) (if she was not a dream and real) i was super into and super pissed society made arbitrary rules i remember arguing with teacher that how would he feel if i made enjoying intimacy or kissing illegal in his agegroup or old people because „maybe“ some peole might be taken advantague off to disallow *all* blanket.

Made no sense but i cant remember. Im kot sure if a doctor once strapped me and gave me a injection and i was crying and said „lets calm and talk about it, maybe mom rolf and a doctor“? Dont think  so but could be a dream or false memory fram the far past maybe that is how i forgot or started having memory problems or whatever maybe not.
[01.10.2023, 02:33:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Think there was a psychoatrist and then when telling mom and snth they did it after maybe they did something wrong and then covered it up.

Already no clue who no chance to know but if i know there was smth then maybe might be able to guess what might have gone wrong with what substances and help. No interesst in finding anyone since impossible and does not help me and i think the person made a mistake or tried to help but in a not so legal way maybe.
[01.10.2023, 03:17:04] Marco Luca Hefti: I dont know what is or is not but if there was anything i would just give the person a unversehrtsheits pardon so they cant be legally implicated in any way at all, i can focus on adhd meds or constructive positive things. Maybe there is nothing then great but if there is i dont want the danger of people fearing legal action from me if there where anything. I want all around total legal immunity for everyone if there is something so if there is (im not saying there is in all those hypotheticals) then i get them off my back/ass🥲

Let me be ill let you be IF ill sign any documents in seconds i am fine that is all that matters no victim no crime otherwise it sets president that merciful or good actors get punished.

Not saying it is victor, some family, or anyone or that there even is but hate does not give anything only constructive things work.
[01.10.2023, 03:20:18] Marco Luca Hefti: Its better for me from gametheroy.
Egoistical.
Philantropic.
Pragmatic.
Best overall life.
Quickest best life.
Best life for everyone.
Best precident for people in the future since such president say: do good be fine.

Again im not paranoid, psychotic, crazy, pedo i just find it woman very beautiful and am slightly more liberal within *legal* age ranges. 
I would NEVER date a illegal age woman. Also i have dated basically noone you can add a bodycamera to my underpants. Im the least layed dude in the universe 🥲😂
[01.10.2023, 03:20:31] Marco Luca Hefti: But Gracie changed that a lot eventho she meets me super rare.
[01.10.2023, 03:40:38] Marco Luca Hefti: AI said my docters praxis is still open not retired
[01.10.2023, 07:37:29] Marco Luca Hefti: -very Short sleep however sleep cycle app says 6h and 8h bed 36% effigency

[01.10.2023, 08:40:27] Marco Luca Hefti: All kinda normal despite short sleep. Barely feel it however i think i feel some effect. Hopefully the long time in bed helped too.
[01.10.2023, 08:40:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad + Grabdparents spontanious meet 11:50 today dad called by whatsapp
[01.10.2023, 10:55:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Luckely they came 5 min kate i was 2 min late. 

Recently i have been perfectly late almost evey time other dosages i never do that or super rare, others i am conistantly early.
[01.10.2023, 10:56:00] Marco Luca Hefti: All inadvertently tested during the last 4 years
[01.10.2023, 13:20:45] Marco Luca Hefti: I yesterday got more intuitions and i feel better about family might be more towards the other hypothesis so feel fine for now.

Eventho i sleept little and the meet was moved forward it seemed from 11:50 to 10:50 making me be late and i am sleep depreived since 2 days.

Pablo also he said but he ususlly seems more fine since no adhd seemed very fit.

People seem eather relaxed or inhibited.

I told pablo about the Victor hypothesis and there are many layers and i keep getting a idea or thought that may change the equasion.

So ja.

Victor told me last time it looked strange that i took rehrücken and i would like to take it but since i dont know investigation would believe the complex victor high iq complex narssisit case i will just take the cheap food. 

Honestly i feel little threat herr so i may take the rehrücken…. Nah just the fish.
This hole thing seems like eather simple or up to very i introcate/complex.

So i am taking more than too little protocoll steps but ja im cool and all is good. 👍
[01.10.2023, 13:20:46] Marco Luca Hefti: Written 12:38 high end restaurant or almost
[01.10.2023, 15:14:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Forgot adhd meds because dad + Grandparents (and then pablo and cornelia came as well without me knowing)
So many things i was told where different and 11:50 became 10:50 well all predictable and nothing new  that i forget meds
[01.10.2023, 15:15:03] Marco Luca Hefti: Dränk Espresso and will not take the 40mg Equasim
[01.10.2023, 15:21:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad teached us how to drink Wine and making this „spitz“ Maul and getting some air to kinda get the flavor.

I am just doing that because dad and all my brothers did that.
[01.10.2023, 15:34:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Restaurant vorbei fahre mit paps alein auf anderer Fahrt
[01.10.2023, 16:35:50] Marco Luca Hefti: 16:34 angekommen. Gemütliche Fahrt über Felder schöne Strecke.

Vater hat fragen zu vielem gestellt und tipps gegeben was ich als oberste peiorität tun soll:
[01.10.2023, 16:55:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Small details before i forget them:
It did not cost much effort and it was more a small messure or that i just felt like it because i "remembered some thing" recently just by chance. I am relaxed and do not think those things matter much but since V. told me they mattered in the past when my medications where taken away when i tryed to work/change to a different psychiatrist i was more carful because autoritys might be thinking they matter, also i wanted a coffee anyways:

I changed some things at the restaurant based on what Victor told me in the forest some investigators (pedo/psychotic/paranoid) may have found suspitious. 
1) Coffee instead of taking the 40 Equasim
2) Dessert instead of no dessert.
3) Look and smile more at Weighter be less affraid he is a pedo. test (im not a p. but in investigations eyes).
4) Drink more water since AI told me to drink enought.
5) Talk more and not just listen.
6) Take some cheaper dish because the expensive one seems like i do not think the family there or dad is a comfortable environment suggesting i am lying and do not think something is off. (Not sure but maybe last time i took the Rehpfeffer if there was a last time i think there was.)
7) Listen to music and Dont just talk about work or write phone AI. Since it might come across as "on too high stimulants without regard for freetime)
8) Something with the sugar.
9) Be mindful when looking out the window since i migh inadvertantly look in the direction of a young lady/child, eventho im 0% inclined since i am into normal legal age and my lover Gracie (hoang trang i meet in Migros work i still meet and have endlessly long WhatsApp conversation AND pictures AND meets regularely (although super rare) with.
Honestly i do not see how those things
[01.10.2023, 17:04:47] Marco Luca Hefti: I feel like the drive there with pablo felt a tiny bit like a deja vu.
[01.10.2023, 17:35:07] Marco Luca Hefti: -Usless details for recall later:
Pablo, Cornelia, Dad seemed slightly more relaxed than Grandparents but Grossmufti seemed very much friendly just a very very slightly more serious maybe or sad. Also Granddad. But that does not mean anything Granddad was depressed before and had SSRI so seemed normal to me. :) Grandma had a new phone said it is a iPhone but it it seemed not usual. It could have been or it could have been a android. It definitly did not look like a normal iPhone but maybe that is just some Zoom feature.

Offered Cornelia to moe the yawn. Grandma asked me to come visit to show her the new phone in the coming days. I accepted right away I also kissed/hugged all like always, they seemed warm and normal maybe just a tiny bit "beklommen" but only super super mega slightly and honestly probably just the sleep that by happenstance was a bit worse just now while it was very good before.
I do not really feel the sleep deprivation much, but maybe because sleep was solid before for weeks and weeks on 40 Eq also on 30 Eq,  20 Equasim i cant remember but probably not too bad. Of course I documented all sleep in the sleep cycle app on my handy since 4 years and i have the corresponding dosage (zb. 30 Strattera + 40 Equasim) for each night so i could easily see how good or bad my sleep was, eventho some of the time the data does have to be interpreted since "asleep" is not always = sleep at least it seems that regular sleep cycles and deep sleep are more of a sure messure. "Sleep Quality" most of the time seems accurate tho. It is to be taken with a grain of salt however all metrics contribute in some way.
[01.10.2023, 17:45:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad said when alone in car:
-confirm travel-date with mom early
-very important for me to go vote (i almost never/never vote because i have more urgent things and medication and much of really serious things and times like these now where i can halvway do a bunch of things are rare) He said that the country might slip into a bad rightwing whatever and renewabl energy if it does not come might be the end of humans (nature may survive but not humans) SO it is a "existential risk"
-He said i should really focus on lerning the solarpro tool i will be using on the job with jerome he gave me to apply to. (I should youtube watch videos of the tool, sun, renewable energy and so on without specifying further, so i am "a crack/really good" when i start) (said i will try to do it however i was slightly concerned that it would undermine all work finding and applying progress because i would be procrastinating since i would think i "already go the job". He said i would be getting 4000k for 100% and less if i work less %.
-He said it is also important to apply for a "Lehrfahrausweis" (töff) (it is important to know that my motorcycle (if it is still existing) is very likely dead battery from inactivity, and i would have to get a licence, number, place to park it, transport, call the place. (Dad said i should just start/call the place and do it on the side is always possible.
-He was angry i let the phone ring 6 timers and i should be faster (i remembered that i was noting down something and did not immediately/faster pick up as usual, i also still being a bit slower than normal and not restored to my full capacity just way better and way more productive/active/less depressed/exhausted/low energy/discomfort/less remembering problems).
-He smiled at me and was relaxed but he also was angry when talking about some things.
[01.10.2023, 17:56:06] Marco Luca Hefti: He asked about details of when i meet Victor, what he said. And told me that "What is Herr Dubach doing?" I dont like it that he geschmückt with foren feathers. *HE* (dad) asked for the meet with Victor, Dubach and me and NOT Herr Dubach. He also was slightly delayed and told us to wait "Warteraum/Zimmer" when the appointment at 9:00. Dad expressed visible dismay with it and also told me that he would be "be pissed" if he found out "they" (or anyone) was messing/doing something for non authentic motives or untruthful (pharaphracing). I thanked him and hugged him and gave him good bye kiss cheek he did too. He seemed controlled and in controls thought, even the slight bursts where rare and nothing above the usual known in the family/cars. In fact i felt at no point like i was threatened or anything.

While i feel a bit like a deja vu and last time the medications where caught off and i also forgot the meds and the meeting was "vorverlegt"  I am relaxed and thankfull for his apparent support. However for contingency i made these logs since in the 4 years many things seemed one way and then somehow where a different way. But all good and explainable it is more the amount and consistency and repeting of things and other stuff where i think a log would not be very bad.
But i hope i do not sound paranoid. I also know that the logs are extensive in the last two days i just had memory's of similar events that then suddenly turned into meds taken away and memory loss and depression and (seemingly ignored) repeated calls for help.
[01.10.2023, 18:00:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad asked who i trust most Victor, Him, Dubach, Rohmeder and who helped most Rohmeder, Dubach, Victor.
I said i generally extend trust to all but i am also taking precautionary messures. And I think there are many red flaggs like my inability to switch to a new psychiatrist and the memory issues and medication discontinuation every time i want to work or feel more self-sufficient and more able to remember past event's.

But as always i am calm and always ready to have a discussion/meet with anyone who desires to control my strict and perfect adherence to Victors commands, also i and maticulously note and take my medication intake and experiences.

[02.10.2023, 08:26:10] Marco Luca Hefti: My handy said i called victor at the 22.8. and 30.9. or 30.8. since dad asked me if it is true that i did not call Victor about the perscription (eventho it was kinda clear that it was needed like every time in the recent years
[02.10.2023, 08:26:42] Marco Luca Hefti: But i might have forgot or not wanted to call once but i thought i did. Just because dad mentioned it here journal.
[02.10.2023, 08:27:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Good stable day so far. Only thing is that im not optimal (as always) (but relatively better since weeks/months) also time moves a but fast i guess that is not time but me since im somethimes forgetting it or something. Hard to say might also be adjustment period of meds maybe.

[02.10.2023, 09:26:25] Marco Luca Hefti: My gf was much much much calmer in the recent months than she is at other times. Often she is so angry and writes terrible things because she feels strong emotions but on the flip side i love her strong positive and intimite emotions like lust, humor, allure, smoothness, and many more things.  Also i am shy (Random ADHD tangent: and somethimes it feels like:  i may be chemically and administatively targeted by a covert narcissistic 167 I.Q. psychopath misusing every problem or sour relationship down to even my ADHD and quirks as well so it is hard to find a girlfriend and also because my ADHD is not well treated and every time i get my life in shape my meds get suddenly taken away i lose part of my recall ability and get overweight and depressed. And because of phychos/paranoia/crazy smears it is a balancing act of writing logs and protecting without being overly seeming paniced or fearful. Also police might be braindead. But haha obviously such ridicolous things would never happen no matter how many red flaggs and outwrite admitting and blank gaslighting to my face where to happen. Feelings glad humans have higher brain abilitys to keep them from making premature judgements 😂 )  So back to my hot precious

 ❤ She is gorgeous. And I like always since want to slap her sexy butt since she said she liked that and kiss her.
[02.10.2023, 09:45:25] Marco Luca Hefti: My sitting position is a bit less upright currently. Nothing new but in the recent weeks it was quite good so this is rare. Maybe i am more relaxed or something or a bit lazy from laying a tiny bit longer in bed when i should have stood up when the meds kicked in. Well nothing new im used to it since 4 yeras and without meds i guess. It is trivial just in case i mention this slightly negative ADHD Symptom (according to victor) anyway.

I bought some food and talked to organisation representatives they said its cheap but then super expensive by year.

Said ill come back when i am financially stable (i guess the complex situation improves like that im fucked mental healthwise so that im a poor dude also need to pay money back dont want to … i mean everyone told me i was giving too much and many comments seem to have influenced my behaviour today honestly.. like i rememberd some comments and such.)
[02.10.2023, 16:57:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Feeling shy not as confident as i was back when i came from the cpp.

Damn i knew i should have gone then but predictably i would be pooped by a bird of course. 

Anyway…. I so guess i gona get numbers from places and call them shy ad i am 🙈
[02.10.2023, 17:05:40] Marco Luca Hefti: Asked for jobs at „gamelife“ since i kinda know about games so eventho i would have liked to work at a different place at least i did it!  🥳 i need the number for the website.

But maybe he is also good guy
[02.10.2023, 19:02:56] Marco Luca Hefti: I think he might be high iq that got mad his gf was mitleid considering actint like she gives me a chance then not giving number.

Then i felt he high iq asked him if he can help because something seemed wrong with medications taking too long
[02.10.2023, 19:03:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Then he used it to seem like he helpes me
[02.10.2023, 19:03:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Then he gets family to fear i tell on them
[02.10.2023, 19:03:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Then they do the dirty work

[02.10.2023, 22:36:47] Marco Luca Hefti: 7 year lover almost always prefers to look herself in the bathroom without me.
[03.10.2023, 00:11:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Gf asked me about Alan (family) asked me if i like transgender, if i would sleep with her if she was a man, if i was gay, was not at all passionate, barely reacted to kiss, enjoyed sex but did nothing herself almost like waiting for me and cant initiate anything herself, she was getting angry at end and exactly after 3 cum left the house and i did not know why. Before all was good. She seemed normal this is nothing new it is the same thing for a long time. It seems every time she enjoys sex the medication get changed or she suddenly "cant meet" or has some new rule why she cant do a fun thing. I feel like she is blackmailed by victor and cant do what she wants. Forced to sex barely enought and otherwise he treatens to blackmail her child and husband about the secret lover. It seemed like that about from the moment i mentioned her to victor and when he by information roughtly got my data. Police might not care because there idea of morality is "marriage til death" or at least someone there would be like that and a person obsessed would get exactly that person.

She looks like a mix of blackmail and investigation. But i cant know if and if i tell anyone im concidered crazy/paranoid/psychotic/lying. I am not saying that it is like that but once again it is a small thing that fits into years of red flaggs. I feel bad if it is the case. To be fair i Dont know it might also just be nothing. And the condom thing as well.
[03.10.2023, 00:29:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Gf told me to open the reverse condoms she had me buy 1-2 years ago and never used and that she could not because of her nails. Then she did not want to use it anyway
[03.10.2023, 07:57:21] Marco Luca Hefti: After the predictably low sleep yesterday because my lover/gf of 7 years suddenly decided to come - my brain is not the best. Unluckely it perfectly coincides with the second zpp meeting.
[03.10.2023, 08:08:49] Marco Luca Hefti: website has this bug again where i wanna send a message but it does not send but deletes instead happened for a year or more but somethimes never somethimes a lot corrolates with lag i guess
[03.10.2023, 08:39:31] Marco Luca Hefti: I told gf yesterday that dad asked information and picture of her again.

She asked not to give it.

I reminded her that victor may know all or can deduce all information about her. She was slightly worried about blakmail. I said he would prpbably come under the shining armor of a just investigation and concern if at all but she should not worrie and if she gets ever blackmailed talk to the police.

She knows all about many things. Not as much as victor tho not even close.

I worrie about her but i an also not sure if many of the things i wrote years ago and suspected are true she seems not like the old person since i told victor about her as part of the treatment.

I do not want to speculate or inmight be seen as too much stimulant or crazy or whatever also dont know if my iphone communication is save because of fake accudation investigation access for „suposed savety“ but i do not even know if there is anything.

Many red flaggs. Memory. Mental health and police/lawyer/family/psychiatrist all my efforts have not gone far. I dont know who to trust so i am more careful and trust everyone a bit but noone too much.
I could also be counter investigation where some act like they are in on smth. and are not. But it could also be lyes to make me believe that and it being way simpler or nothing. Fact is i have no chance if family wants to protect someone or if Victor did not lye and is 167 iq while i still have memory issues.

I got to stay calm (and since my life is nothing but hard it is easy to be calm). I just focus on the job to not have the medication taken away every time i tried to change to a other psychiatrist or when i start to get too independent. for some reason.

8:36

I wish i knew because i cant life as effectively as i could with those questions and people behaving strange.

I just want to not be without friends, without people that really care and not sell me out at the first chance (talking past friends who when it mattered did not really care i think it might have to do wtith low drive and variable cognition meaning slow turned off brain until X situation where it is shortly way better like in high immediate emergency or other adhd situations).

Anyway job stuff later now shower
[03.10.2023, 08:40:00] Marco Luca Hefti: I am very normal i just remember this all (last months of events) seeming familiar
[03.10.2023, 09:28:17] Marco Luca Hefti: distracted cant think clearly. Clearly Victor ADHD treatment is not standard everyone says so i know from my research but somehow i cant get away. And then i am judged based on no or bad medication from childhood.
[03.10.2023, 09:28:50] Marco Luca Hefti: It is not that my thinking is weird it is just some sort of brainfog where the memory like "what to do next" does not appear or very slowly.
[03.10.2023, 09:29:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Lack of sleep exasserbates. Not good for the big meet today.
[03.10.2023, 09:45:41] Marco Luca Hefti: It looks like im not doing much but i am thinking a lot. The same thoughts i had int he past. It is like thinking and routeplaning and such at the same time. Almost like my subcontious says "this thought is important" it is not random stuff never about a tv show or anything it is applicapple to the last 4 years and the seemingly big issue or situation at hand.

I guess my brain is trying to problemsolve and find the solution. Currently i may think it is about appreances and the complex nouances of my philosophy that people seem to not understand if they talk to me (well obviously) but when they do it is easy. Anyway..... it is also about yesterday and this hole thing. Anyway i gotta do this other stuff and do the "Bewerben" despite all these Memorys /thoughts coming back now.

I am totally normal and calm i could work but when im in quiet and do not have a clear plan (i guess executive function) meaning that even if i write it down i still would have to reread it over and over. Almost like my "thinking" is creating everything from scratch instead of just remembering a plan. I guess memory is at issue. Maybe noradrenalin reuptake needs to be increased and dopamine reuptake stay the same or lower or the other way around where you have your thoughts persistant then organize them into a plan which you then execute with the "performance" oriented PFC which is noradrenalin heavy. Anyway just for protocol in case it becomes relevant at some point if i would be held down for some legal things and it would be hard to explain why i did or did not do X, Y, or Z in this or another situation. Having this log allows me to remember and explain my thought process and why i did what i did. It may be a sort of artificiall memory extension until my ADHD medication is done by a ADHD psychiatrist and it works mostly automatically where this would be less nessesary. Also becuase of the advice for narcisisstic psychopaths and just in general for legal protection or later for analysis with Language Models or just to check on certain periods relating the medications.
[03.10.2023, 09:46:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Back to planning for zpp meeting and writing down job offers for later contact.
[03.10.2023, 10:10:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Since i have been int he city for quite a while and walked around i saw someone who looked familiar like a classmatte that had some trouble with me but not too much. He stood not far from the church and the science wall when i walked throught the bankverein/church/theather stairs down to copy quick to get my CV's other than that noone seemed familiar from the past exept some stuff but only relating to the last 4 years. Just as last time i wanted to get a psychiatrist and wanted to work and then family invited me to the same things and all and i had the same suggestion to go to ZPP from Herr Schneider. I am not there the first time. However i do not know if appart form the email i received last time there is much of a papertrail exept the person asking vor a "vollmacht" during the zpp treatment to be able to ask Herr Dubach some things. Since it would be weird not to do it i did it.

[03.10.2023, 10:33:12] Marco Luca Hefti: i cant work because the service i relly on to help me do stuff Dont work all day today
[03.10.2023, 10:43:03] Marco Luca Hefti: family told me many many many things to keep track off i have so many timers and things to keep track of also almost strategically unlucky meet timings somethime ^^ Coincidences that is why its good to prepare early and have a real ADHD psychiatrist and to the standard stuff and not a mix of strattera + stimulant (i guess) but all seems fine noone said anything is wrong.
[03.10.2023, 10:44:50] Marco Luca Hefti: (exept some stuff where im not sure it is a test for "if im psychotic" or whatever or some stuff outright but i already did contact people and every time im ignored or turned down and i cant do much because family + some people vs me i will always lose a contest of who will be believed and i am not even sure whats going on or if. I guess im doubting myself as well.
[03.10.2023, 10:45:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Eventhough that usually is not useful im rarely totally off or wrong where it matters. Just slow to be sure
‎[03.10.2023, 10:47:44] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[03.10.2023, 10:48:01] Marco Luca Hefti: later adding the spontanious employment visists i did but the papertrail might be the problem there

[03.10.2023, 12:37:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Antivirus does not work did more clothes thing. I hope my humor YouTube comments (some of them also influenced by drug up and down so called "ADHD treatment i trie to flee all this time" is not used to somehow rail up religous parts of my family or "sacrefice a pedo" kinda like Jesus eventho it makes little sense and seems more the opposite of what it should be also the child killing thing. When i say "godking" it is a exxaggeration that is designed to be ridicoulous obviously. I always said i respected god if real and i just do not want to act like i know or it is hard without meds to be sure of stuff so i just say "If real real" "If good then good"

I gues the gay argumentation/defending is also a possible thing to be used or the trans stuff. But i never said it is moral or great to be gay i just said that i Dont see whats hate and conflict is helping when you are born that way. Litterally a higher power if evotlution or god made it then i wont judge BUT i also said if there is desease or it is shown to be bad in some way or something i am not gona ignore the evidence but you cant hate people for no good reason because humans have always been wrong and right and this hate and brutal stuff (there is a time for defensive violence sure police and if you have to war or juditial system judges and so on. But if you beleive in god let him judge when we die naturally aka get called or smth otherwise it seems to be ur saying u know better.

Also u think i want immortality? Fine i would like to live longer BUT i do not want to be immortal when it means the essence of me or whatever 1. of all. 2. of all, we are NOWHERE near there 3) of all desease can always still take you or you might just die anyway we Dont understand much there is endless possibility in microbiology. I you think that maybe you undestimate god and/or evolution. 4) Do it then not based on manipulation of what could be concidered a snake that appears good. 5) U think a allpowerful creater of the universe cant deal with some new medicine or technology? I think you should look into microbiology and quantum phsysics trust me there is LOOOOTs of room that humans have not explored. And this stuff has been around for centurys it just takes a while and is slow. Which is fine but if you want to strive for good and paradise on earth or war and stagnation. Tradition and Culture come too short. I can never do them because i Dont have enought time. So Many rich people reconnect with simpler things and Dont life in a crazy computer. They just use the automation like a windmill angetrieben by water and the technology got handed down over generations and what AI is simple concepts made better and then you can skip some modern boring and sickening stuff like sitting and staring into a computer all day.

If you want a word where you do that stuff you become the machine yourself. I am conciderate of everything all i know i lerned form teachers, family, life expereicnes, and such it is not 1 thing or  a few rich people or thought leaders. Dont get manipulated. Just to make sure i write this here so if it gets read then i hope those false assumptions are hopefully corrected. Also i have no following and i dont claim to be god. (Exxaggeration jokes like "Whoo i jut take airplain glue: bla bla bla" are part of banter obviously they are ment to make fun of X

I wrote like 55k comments some saying the good in religion some critical some quite bad but i also like to reflect what people say just so they see how crazy it sounds somethimes so i do not beleieve that that is a technique called (forgot but its like a strawman (which is covert) but open to show "you are saying XYZ??" a strawman would be subtle like "Oh okay so because you say xy therefore bla bla" and it is much more manipulative i Dont like strawmans. I cant think of the right name. Maybe a ...... "reflecting what the other party said back to show some flaw or imbalance"
[03.10.2023, 12:40:32] Marco Luca Hefti: im good on time. So because im kinda scared of what V said and people who may go thorght persons history and use anyhting they can find to smear character i am a tiny bit paranoid. But im relaxed and my response is to write more CV or to dress better and talk to more people and anything that is concidered "brav" and "normal/regular" or giving in more and checking why people might be mad. But noone seems to what to talk since the medication being bad and the hole situation makes it hard but i always did and i will continue too. I also want to do philantropic things and the list does not include to throw anyone of any throne or to attack a instiution or to smear or use force more win-win (focusing on what everyone kinda consideres good, i say kinda because technology may even be seen as scary so i am also into aligning maning *CONTAINING* AI "Alingment"
[03.10.2023, 12:40:36] Marco Luca Hefti: And into savety
[03.10.2023, 12:41:25] Marco Luca Hefti: And im not into surveilance state however my experiences would make it more desirable for some people like me to be survailanced 24/7 for protection and so people Dont do bad stuff the poisonus covert way.
[03.10.2023, 12:41:39] Marco Luca Hefti: So i searched a lot of job description thingies
[03.10.2023, 12:41:47] Marco Luca Hefti: And i will apply I ironed my clothes
[03.10.2023, 12:41:54] Marco Luca Hefti: I got the plan where i need to drive.
[03.10.2023, 12:41:59] Marco Luca Hefti: I checked the calendar.
[03.10.2023, 12:42:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Got a Eye on time.
[03.10.2023, 12:44:23] Marco Luca Hefti: I am a agnostic or not claiming to know exactly what is true and Dont tell other people to stop doing smth. I only say stuff that is as win-win as possible and some stuff when i feel like noone reads it anyway or joke or when i feel like something but those usually are just out of context. I can explain everything 100% and if you know all then you would think "damn that dude is a really really good person"
Because if society/economy is better i will also be better.
[03.10.2023, 12:48:26] Marco Luca Hefti: I am super late had to write fast
[03.10.2023, 12:48:37] Marco Luca Hefti: some how forgot time just for a moment and already..... man
[03.10.2023, 12:53:49] Marco Luca Hefti: If i gave 360 franks to the plan help organisation then it seems like im guilty
[03.10.2023, 13:22:10] Marco Luca Hefti: I forgot time before going to appointment luckely i anticipated that while not remembering other things in time like getting a ticket.
[03.10.2023, 13:22:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Or the timers
[03.10.2023, 13:23:04] Marco Luca Hefti: I should have put them earlyer i knew i mean every child does but that is the timing component of adhd and/or false meds.
[03.10.2023, 13:23:14] Marco Luca Hefti: But im super punctual
[03.10.2023, 13:24:32] Marco Luca Hefti: 5 Minutes early. Eventho i also did not remember the traffic change that only happens like once every 1-2 years unlucky.
[03.10.2023, 13:26:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Dont take the stairs this time because sweat hot day
[03.10.2023, 13:26:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Coincidently
[03.10.2023, 13:27:02] Marco Luca Hefti: I take the stairs at the gym somethimes a lot mostly when i feel morivated and good medication or good mood
[03.10.2023, 13:27:18] Marco Luca Hefti: And i try to always take them down if i dont have to write something
[03.10.2023, 14:57:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor told me once because i did not look at the Handwerker (1 seemingly young) or that i went to the park might mean im not so „distressed“ that i dont do [small changes in route to get more nature and „recharge“] or said differently „a person feeling under threat might just run to the bus“ (obvioulsy that is ridiculous if it is not a bear) 

but such small things dont seem to make much of a difference to me because if i am too worried or not worried enought both lead to less work singe without optimal meds (maybe i just require a very high or very spesific or low medication) i generally have no advantague to paniking in fact it could even seem like i am on worse meds when they are better or something. When i am worried right now i flee more into making more logs which are my „savety“ preparations so to say


I do not even know for sure what or why or what not of the hypothesis ranging from strong misjudgements to medium or in the very worst case something very severe) 

Also he mentioned visiting Grandma might seem like i am not scared or smth.

But i cant be worried about everything andas Victor knowd i somethimes worrie if i am wrong even if everything os screaming im right. I guess the variability in confidence/motivation/adhd might be part of it…
[03.10.2023, 14:59:30] Marco Luca Hefti: I know i forgot the Stimulants when rushing to the ZPP meeting however it is not a big deal because stimulants ad Victor said are not as severe when slightly delayed as Strattera would be. Still it is the second time and it seemed to be exactly like that the last time i did ZPP too when i was better and when dad invited to a Restaurant meeting and then seemingly „vorverlegt“ it.

DIS - 2.5 Wochen stationär aber frei ein und aus ausser negative Reporte kommen (Gefahr oder so, weil viele Personen dabei leider habe ich da keine Kredibilität aleine)

-> oder ambulant 1x bis 4x pro Woche
[03.10.2023, 15:13:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Have gesagt ambulant, oder tests, oder body canera jederzeit auch sehr intensive ambulant ok solange RAV aber auch gesagt weil ja alles besstens scheint gebe es keinen Grund auch viel und ruhig anderes geredet bin super entspannt.
[03.10.2023, 15:20:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Zufälligerweise haben wind und adhs timer weil ich mehr mache und nicht depressiv bin und „fake work“ von Vater (oder besser gesagt sehr nette „du kannst endlos ausfallen wenn medikation und anderes nicht stimmen)  genau dann die Aufnahme unterbrochen. Aber ist ja nicht schlimm.

[03.10.2023, 17:04:37] Marco Luca Hefti: i was recommended this storry multible times so ill check out the isak storry again because maybe some hint there not like im religous or not im just a win-win loving dude on the pursuit of happyness while being a good person and then doing philantropy amidst other fun stuff like lerning, exploring, discovering, building, playing, helping, leisure, philosophy, art and such work stuff like that. Experience looking for good expereice trying to avoid bad and trying to sustain experience aka staying alive. Pretty humble simple stuff im not saying all at once (would be nice) as best as i can. As everyone i guess. And the spiritual dimension exploring is also on my bucket list but mental health and feeling bad and worries and unsure what best to do are all also there making it tricky.
[03.10.2023, 17:04:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Just in case someone reads this as it is a private chat noone has access to.
[03.10.2023, 17:05:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Or for later many reasons.
[03.10.2023, 17:05:21] Marco Luca Hefti: journaling/protocol
[03.10.2023, 17:23:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Oh okay now i really got the storry. Its about trusting even if it seems dire. That is what i do. But since i do not know where "god" ends and "greed/selfish intrigue/jealousy/fear/illusion" begin i of course will not like that i am tied up. But yes the idea of being a "good person" and really not just in oberlächlichem like some stuff that looks nice in your Facebook like "helps pick up trash" (not saying it is not good just that if you do it for the looks then it is not really....... well it is complicated you may do it so you can archive the ability to do good by perception first since you feel people go by perception and not real impact and they might not see or understand what you do or feel it is bad without knowing without discussing or asking.

If anyone reads this ask me and Dont be shy to insist that you want to understand why i do things and why i think i overall am good even when im not perfect as no human is.

This is what i would say.

But since this might sounds crazy...... or psychotic.... i am totally normal and i do not beleive i will be sacrificed or definitly not that i would sacrifice anyone. And i definitly did not hear from what i think if god or anything that i should. I am just sacrificing my time and effort to get a job which will then provide money and then i will give some back. Even if it is small and trivial money simple.

The stuff i did on YouTube is more impactful but most is not it is hard to spot the needly in the hey and even harder not to think it is all menur (or the word for poop+heey).

AND climat change is also improved by better economy because currently the problem is that people feel like they have to decide between money vs environment and they Dont want to do more than certain lets say "5%" so if you increase the hole cake of 100% to be bigger then the slice of 5% will also automatically be bigger without anyone losing exept advancement which can in rare cases if too fast or done wrong also have negative consequences but everything i advocated and contributed to overall does not at least noone can argue why and i already think about alignment for long.

Planet, alignment, individual happyness of people even if hard to understand, unknown things

And when im better off i can also engage better and ask and lern about negative consequences when im fucked i Dont have so much luxury and people seem to avoid me and not want to talk i always talked about any concern if the person seemed non thretening or when i had the motivation/confidence.
[03.10.2023, 17:24:09] Marco Luca Hefti: back to work a company about recycling came and i said i have to work but i will remember the name and add it to chat
[03.10.2023, 17:34:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Evo House Recycling said no time but i wrote it down because coincidences and i kinda feel like maybe i should do some visible non hard to understand thing with low impact and high visability. However maybe i also want to humble myself to the possibility of seemingly small deeds. (Butterflyeffect/dominoeffect/unknown). (Environment is also something on my bucket list but i guess it is very far in the future and i may have neglegted shortterm stuff
[03.10.2023, 17:37:56] Marco Luca Hefti: It maybe be this "what the hell did i do wrong" i guess i need to do stuff that "looks" good not IS actually impactful.

The "rich people" = larger CO2 footprint i believe is temporary. But if not i advice a tax roughtly slowly ramped up. And CO2 certificates i guess i can check out why they did not work so far i think i already did and i already commented and wrote about it years ago somewhere in my 55k YouTube comments if the comment has not been deleted or made private so the person can make cool videos with the ideas in it.
[03.10.2023, 17:39:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Generally when you look at slams or poor countrys the trash mountains and plastic is gigantic. If you look in rich switzlernad or hotels it often seems they have al recycled sutff and Teslas isntead of normal cars and lots of clean nature also money to subsidice farmers to care for environment. I just got a bit of lust to check it out but i gotta apply or something happens and my meds get taken away because i did not apply enought eventhough i did.
[03.10.2023, 17:39:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Like last time.
[03.10.2023, 17:40:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Seemingly eventho i never received a official notice to my knowledge only people telling me or seemingly flimsy/gaslighting/nonsensical explanations and no course of appeal. At least not where i tried.

[03.10.2023, 18:11:48] Marco Luca Hefti: the adress i mean i wrote the other stuff
[03.10.2023, 18:11:56] Marco Luca Hefti: and correspondance myself of course
[03.10.2023, 18:12:12] Marco Luca Hefti: 6 emails or so weeks ago
[03.10.2023, 18:12:50] Marco Luca Hefti: after the flood of RAV documents and doing 20 other stuff way more than before when i was fat depressed and employed dad but was rarely able to work basically 95% of the time
[03.10.2023, 18:13:03] Marco Luca Hefti: maybe exxaggerating
[03.10.2023, 18:13:15] Marco Luca Hefti: maybe not
[03.10.2023, 18:30:49] Marco Luca Hefti: i will eat something so brain works better really quick small snack
[03.10.2023, 20:08:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Man. Memorys of some things come back and i am kinda helpless since it seems quite unlikely and even thought i tried to call for help really early i am not sure it was enought. This is why i wrote the Hausärzte eventho i was more concerned with the work thing. Just so people cant say i did not try.
[03.10.2023, 20:14:37] Marco Luca Hefti: cant send emails anymore it seems i send a email to a Hausarzt praxis politely asking if they have space and it said "error sending email"
[03.10.2023, 20:15:45] Marco Luca Hefti: anxiety because the email does not work and because of the things repeating fear from victor or whatever is going on.
[03.10.2023, 20:17:14] Marco Luca Hefti: But only this evening maybe i worked too long and the mind wanders and remembers. Well i had anxiety before i can deal with it with meditation and taking a break i have regularily eaten and i did sleep quite okay for that my gf coincidently came here yesterday.
[03.10.2023, 20:19:38] Marco Luca Hefti: sent some correspondance for changing Hausarzt in case this time it is really a retirement (felt like this was said before and then i was gaslighted and i had to accept that it was probably just a test)
[03.10.2023, 20:19:58] Marco Luca Hefti: I dont mind tests as long as im save. :)
[03.10.2023, 20:20:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Man i have such resiliance xD
[03.10.2023, 20:24:18] Marco Luca Hefti: email does not work
[03.10.2023, 20:24:24] Marco Luca Hefti: i think i am hacked
[03.10.2023, 20:24:41] Marco Luca Hefti: or something but this is never happening outside of this time that repeats
[03.10.2023, 20:25:08] Marco Luca Hefti: I guess my screenshots and everything i tried to document will also be gone or not matter
[03.10.2023, 20:27:24] Marco Luca Hefti: To be fair if people just try to test me for something then it is fine since it is not really needed or pointless to change doctor but the kind of investigation eather in my favor or just part of smear campains from very young matters i guess. Anyway maybe it is just another coincidence and email on phone, pc, and many other thigns just did not work today. I am not psychotic or paranoid or crazy so it is also hard to make protocol wihtout seeming crazy it is lose lose lose no matter what i do i guess so the best course is to just relax.
[03.10.2023, 20:30:32] Marco Luca Hefti: My memory is not erradic it is calm and stable but for sertain times in the past it seems to somethimes come depending on medications or maybe what events let me remind somethiung that is related to it. So my behaviour changes so to say as the "memory reveils itself and i remember more and more"  changing my strategys to try to be protected
[03.10.2023, 20:32:45] Marco Luca Hefti: If some legal thing or counter-investigation is reading the stuff too. Not saying there is. I just have this phase where many things remind me of what happened in the past. Like what family does where we go what appointments are given to me and i go to and such. I am no danger i am just writing a bit more logs.
[03.10.2023, 21:44:05] Marco Luca Hefti: I did meditation. Since i am worried i think what i could have done wrong and i dont think i decerve but when thinking of bullyes i can easily forgive by focusing on the good and also see everything in perspective but i hope this wont make it so that some people are negatively affected by some form of carma. I rememebrt discussions with victor about microbiology and what he said about the unknown of depression or even illness. How am i to blame i am just a human i seem to have no controll over those things. But when im hit or hated do i then have to also be guilty if something happens like the person becoming sad.

Anyway i wanned to check on Reto Müller not from anger but from concern.

But it is unwise to do so 1. because i dont want to seem crazy and it is just a unproven idea or karma or whatever. 2. If someone hits you hole the other cheek is pretty fitting even for agnostics (that try to pay respect and humility to the very large number of spiritual/religious people and balance the logical/scientific mind with emotional/spiritual
so to say.
However i did try to do that years ago. And i always had a mindset of taking the good from both worlds.

Id say this shift happened for a long time. It was more spiritual then more logical then a symbiosis with a shift towards the missing balance.

Interessing. I enjoy very much intellectually that i am not going with 1 idea no matter what. Ignoring the downsides and missed out potentials.

Man my philosophy and nouanced worldview (although very much simplifiable) … i hope it does not sound like im suddenly religious or whatever psychotic.

I can explain my very limited and very consistant believes and assumptions.

I think they are very balanced but not perfect for sure also a lot of unknowns and things who could wonderfully expand/shift/deepen it.
[03.10.2023, 21:48:02] Marco Luca Hefti: What would also be nice is a evening slight snack. However. I ate quite frequently every 3-4… maybe ill leave it simple… i became more fit over the weeks someone said frequent meals can „give you a sixpack“ while i do not have that somethimes the stomage is quite flat while the shoulders seem to be stronger. I remember when i was quite the opposite.

So that is positive medication wise.

Training discomfort is less pronounced (still there ofc.)
[03.10.2023, 22:08:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Both in terms of responsiblilities. Life at least seems not boring eventho definitly needs less "push and more pull". That is the positive. I did spend a lot of time (eventhoug distracted in thought/ even worries regularily while) working so harder than i thought to make applications. And i talked to thomasz. Maybe seemed more calm then.

[04.10.2023, 08:55:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Tiny bit too late a bee or Bumblebee (was quite big) was in my Window and refusing to go. I think i might have made it in time otherwise.

Already called Herr Dubach M. early 5-7 min late. But maybe if i walk fast. Also different Tram connections. Luckely i knew to use the BVB app.

Not much time to do much Applications in the time before Herr Dubach.
[04.10.2023, 08:58:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Tram has redirects so even the BVB APP did not show/predict that. For that reason it will be even slightly later.
[04.10.2023, 08:59:54] Marco Luca Hefti: Aeschenplatz instead of the normal Route.
[04.10.2023, 09:37:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Herr Dubach almost seem slight signs of wet eyes the knee operation must have been quite painful. He said there where complications with part of it. This was his second op.

« Never change a winning bet/horse » good spruch from Herr D.  i guess it is savest to not change meds and just apply for work.

[04.10.2023, 22:34:15] Marco Luca Hefti: They also where happy i cam warm huggs. Had me add WiFi passwords but the real one came later the first 3 where quite confusing long and very complicated with symbols the grandparents or me where not sure we tried every combination then grandpa found a letter which a simple Passwort it instantly worked.
[04.10.2023, 22:35:17] Marco Luca Hefti: I was smooth cool and calm/relaxed. Not great becuse lots to do and very little freetime but way better than before in the last years most of the time depending on dosage/Mediation combination.
[04.10.2023, 22:38:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Some people on the stairs i rarely or havent seen before recent days and some time i guess. But who knows might just be neighboughs that walk there rarely.

[05.10.2023, 10:26:15] Marco Luca Hefti: tales 3 minutes for some querys and every time i send a command to chatgpt (which i did every day hundereds of times for yeras and it was never like that) it just deletes the message and then after minutes it gets throught and super slowly a answer appears it is like word or exell or email lagging with 1minute delay and somethimes less obviously everyone would be slow eventho i would be way way faster and concentration is way better

[05.10.2023, 13:55:14] Marco Luca Hefti: anxiety like discomfort when triing to work brain a bit like i did not sleep enought or no coffee or tired brain without being tired
[05.10.2023, 13:55:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Nothing new always like that just now a bit more also breathing impulse seems weak.
[05.10.2023, 16:49:14] Marco Luca Hefti: websites are super slow since i have more focus to do the arebeitsbemühungen
[05.10.2023, 16:49:27] Marco Luca Hefti: It is almost like im getting stones layed in my way
[05.10.2023, 17:37:31] Marco Luca Hefti: adhd focus problems right now and mild but relatively constant anxiety (it would go away if i played a video game after a while i intuit) i might have also been slightyl overworked (doing nothing else for the last week i guess exept super small breaks the breaks seem not focused and the work engagements seem not focused it is like never really work never really break makes it very non effitient. 17:33 05.10.2023
[05.10.2023, 17:40:10] Marco Luca Hefti: work tools still very much nonresponsive however variable thoght the day still working all day with some breaks for food and focus
[05.10.2023, 19:37:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Since i had some small puzzle peaces as memorys in my basyen reasoning my behaviour changed accordingly.

Still pretty much the same as always tho. I did a lot of sitting pc applications and such now tiny walk then 5min meditation then back to work or hon good night text.
[05.10.2023, 19:40:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Unluckely the grass has been trimmed where the Grasshopper(s) /nature sound where. Just as i startet the walks again ~ but i discovered some slightly new walk route 😊🙂
[05.10.2023, 20:38:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Ate. 

Seems like roomate used the dryer for 1 thing again or took iut the rest already.

I will ask next time but i do not want to seem anything but normal since becuase of the gaslighting i have a bit of problems with trust. Also because not allowing me normal adhd treatment monotherapy of a normal psychiatrist non family and dad showing up in minutes to get me feom the lawyer when mees where cut off
[05.10.2023, 20:39:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Just…. Ja also people seeming to make subtle comments somethimes where i think « huh »? What? Why would they say that if there is not some bad reporting going on ja whatever…
[05.10.2023, 20:39:55] Marco Luca Hefti: Just concentrating on applying for a job which is the hardest part.
[05.10.2023, 20:40:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Job is usually way easier
[06.10.2023, 08:38:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Interessting how the period where my mail does not send some or i cant find some mail i know i sent is exactly when i would just need to do a few more "Bewerbungen" the outlook seemed to be changing exactly now. I wrote in my whatsapp log/daily journal/medication/life protocol (Victor has access to and before that it was our whatsapp chat that served a dual purpose) that i have trouble with outlok and i like the simple windows mail outlook. And it usually without the right meds takes me very long to get used to new things.
[06.10.2023, 08:39:59] Marco Luca Hefti: So a unlucky coincidence. Also maybe it is not the best idea to write everything in whatsapp chat logs because they are connected to the internet and i did not have antivirus on phone and pc so. And even with antivirus ive been told by some at FHNW that it is not the insurmountable wall that people may believe it is.

[07.10.2023, 16:56:32] Marco Luca Hefti: In the gym currently. It is crazy to hear absence of my age woman all seeming not sure if 16-17-to 24 and rest like 39 or smth

[07.10.2023, 17:22:22] Marco Luca Hefti: Good training so far eventho i was worried my social competancy would not be the  best.
[07.10.2023, 17:23:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Dosage still delivers better than most of last 4 years but of course less than many times hidden somewhere, even weeks or month. But now 40 Eq + 30 str = solid
[07.10.2023, 17:23:47] Marco Luca Hefti: relative. I can do things. Just need to win the application battle
[07.10.2023, 17:43:53] Marco Luca Hefti: Muscles have brain connection meaning similar activation patterns would change likelyhood of memories and other things i speculate.

Since some activitys evolutiinary and epigenetically corrolate with certain muscle activation

[07.10.2023, 20:55:21] Marco Luca Hefti: As i become older i become slightly more spiritual or inclined to lern about traditions i guess youth is trust and age is slowly worked wisdom and 20ies are chaos. Who knows i still hold that i dont know enought especially since it is hard to know stuff when your withheld ADHD treatment since the hole point is to have more drive and curiosity and bette selfcontroll and emotional maturity and such E.F. functions and attention. Mostly Focus that is really important to read non childish things or things that are not immediately appealing to the eye instinctually.
[08.10.2023, 06:41:11] Marco Luca Hefti: 14:00 might be the worst time to meet because 14:00-15:00 has 30 min of Eq. Drop + Einsetzten so pretty unstable and adhd Symthom rarely meet at that time. But maybe there is some strategy behind it. I will be flexible

[08.10.2023, 17:59:53] Marco Luca Hefti: It is 17:59 8.10.2023
[08.10.2023, 18:44:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor asked for blood markes from the doctor. For iron or smth
[08.10.2023, 18:45:25] Marco Luca Hefti: He said meds stay this way all good.

He said apotheke he writes them because of Equasim Perscription today and puts me in CC
[09.10.2023, 00:00:43] Marco Luca Hefti: So far i have no reived a Bcc/cc email of Victor writing the Apotheke about the Equasim Perscription as he said he would today. But ill write it and send it to him to send tomorrow if it is true that he did barely sleep for 48 hours becuase of some Altersheim job and not because h fucked my luver that barely fucks me and does not allow me to to anal, lick her (super rare she does allow and cums 100% of the time), any finger or anythign inside of her exept penis, no tounge kissing and does not kiss back much, no masse to me, no blowjob to me (that is really really really hard on me), no cum in mouth or cum while lick or bj, no looking at her naked body always runs away exept quick and some angle and gets mad if too long or where it would be fun, lots of massage and only 3 cum exactly and instant leave every time. (or less), super rarely rides me but 80% of the time gets tired/loses motivation and goes off or short. Never reverse never allows to do the 100000000x thigns i want and so on. So ja that would be relly shitty.
[09.10.2023, 00:01:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Not a fuck but purpusfully keeping me from those for hate or fun but hey that is really unlikely.
[09.10.2023, 00:01:53] Marco Luca Hefti: So was cinema /kino with brothers watched movie about AI
[09.10.2023, 00:03:04] Marco Luca Hefti: The guardian or smth. The AI child that can turn off or controll tech and the black and asian lover and the  space station whatever war of asia vs USA or smth.
[09.10.2023, 12:09:28] Marco Luca Hefti: discomfort maybe from low sleep
[09.10.2023, 12:12:42] Marco Luca Hefti: websites do not seem to work
[09.10.2023, 13:33:48] Marco Luca Hefti: V. Said that if 40 Equasim works for worse maybe when taken 14:30 right away maybe delay it to smth like 6:30-14:45 then take the 2. one.
But it is optional so far it seems to be fine
[09.10.2023, 14:06:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Anxiety when trying to do a simple email Bewerbung
[09.10.2023, 14:08:09] Marco Luca Hefti: really annoying also beacause somethimes i have it 0% meaning i feel perfect and very fast and capable and it is 20x easyer now i am a bit like someone that rearanges his untensils 10 times before starting because overwelm of Brian or something and kinda constant holding my breath as if im tring to force something and my brain triing to really avoid doing it. Strange.

[09.10.2023, 16:36:23] Marco Luca Hefti: About the owner of the apartment-complex i lived in 2017 (Bleichestrasse 7)
‎[09.10.2023, 16:55:26] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[09.10.2023, 18:05:26] Marco Luca Hefti: I am leaving out a bunch of details form meets and conversation i guess. Dont want to seem over analyzing every detail, or even seem off, also not the most drive it is already in the past years most conversations have elements or parts of the past so the old logs should suffice.  Also if WhatsApp is listened to for some pedo/psychotic/medication thing or whatever then ja. I just want to do my thing. Brian not the best but way better than before still worlds from my brilliant/witty/quick to recall and work and intuitive and everything very socially attuned smart almost like i can be witty and funny in the moment so often. Like i got twice the RAM or processing power. Anyway. Very predictable pretty normal. Ive been on these dosages int he past and i am glad i can just do my thing eventho very slowly at times it might pick up.. Wont complain thankful for the improvement. Just working and such stuff. Pretty normal and im training a bunch more. Good enought just really wanna do the right stuff and make everyone happy or if not possible happy enought.
[09.10.2023, 18:06:47] Marco Luca Hefti: It is also a lot. Last meet was 1.5 hours and a looooooot has been said. And somethimes i can forget my own sentence in the last 4 years at many points. At other points i can remember things insanely well and detailed its all a matter of dosage, lifestyle, luck and unknown factors i guess. Really predictable in some regards and the amount of changes possible are mindboggling.
[09.10.2023, 18:06:58] Marco Luca Hefti: (depending on med for example)
[09.10.2023, 20:00:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Vicor last meet asked how the relationship was doing in said «´It is okay’»  he said im sorry to hear that based on tone.

Today gf wrote and was a bit upset but when she is upset or not meeting long then she is all the more passionate next meet even when she masturbated. Think she is just having this endless memory think meeting too much tires her out where she then loses drive not sure.
[09.10.2023, 20:01:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Ate some protein
[09.10.2023, 20:01:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Have not sleept much so unlucky day for her to text
[09.10.2023, 20:02:56] Marco Luca Hefti: But i am always there no matter how i feel or do
[09.10.2023, 20:25:24] Marco Luca Hefti: I feel like the YouTube recommendations gaslight you somethimes :D But the YT algorythm is really attuned some of the time but often bad recommendations it seems. Somethimes so wrong it is almost sarcastic.
Then it is brilliant at other times. Guess machine lerning with multible variables. But fascinating how vastley removed things can corrolate and somehow it figures out stuff even without context. Not nessesarily applicable but when i did not have a pillow i saw many pillow adds and although that can be explained by psychological phenomena there have been reports and storries over the century about really insane predictions.
[09.10.2023, 20:25:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Fascinating.
[09.10.2023, 20:26:11] Marco Luca Hefti: And the day already over man..
[09.10.2023, 20:26:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Depends on sleep/meds and other things i guess. Can be really different eventho not much change in the last months but i know from the last 4 years of tests aka Victor algorythm/method
[09.10.2023, 20:27:13] Marco Luca Hefti: 's*
[09.10.2023, 21:13:52] Marco Luca Hefti: browser/apps take very long common theme in recent times guess many tapps open
[10.10.2023, 13:24:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Roommate back
[10.10.2023, 13:24:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Travled
[10.10.2023, 15:17:54] Marco Luca Hefti: Called 4 places « abart told me he would call me between 5 and 6
[10.10.2023, 17:35:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Called a few times back and Forth with Hausabwart of Motorcycle place. About to leave gym. :>

[10.10.2023, 17:44:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Im super humble guess it is variable but im super humble and open to feedback when it matters always but people just refuse to talk or friends without the right adhd meds and bad experiences i guess.

*It is always easyer to sit on the high horse and be moral without strong mental health problems and strong adversity even if not visible.*
At least seems that way when im brilliant and feel good its easy to do stuff since i can adapt easily and have the drive and such also emotional intelligence and explaining intuition.

Hard to explain :]
[10.10.2023, 17:46:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Definitly not perfect but i would be insanely impressed by someone like me from the outside. Exept some grayzones but even there 100% but ja definitly flawed but definitly not much noone ever argues and if they do its super easy. Anyway contingency texts….

Nice gym nice day. Discomfort slow at finding work but definitly better than last 4 years at many points but not all. :)
[10.10.2023, 17:47:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Grateful texts inc going other chat
[10.10.2023, 18:12:58] Marco Luca Hefti: The children are (platonically ofc) suuuuper cute i would look way more if i was not worried some crazy dude would think i want to r anyone. 😅😆😂
[10.10.2023, 18:29:26] Marco Luca Hefti: Im going to look at anyone who smiles at me and acts flirty. Does not mean i would date. Especially if they seem legal aga or barely but i would never f them. 

Some look like 25 y old versions just minimally smoother skin and slightly smaler but my lover is suoer small (🤍 to her no insult appreachate her) and over 31 years old accordibg to her defintily super mega not much younger (she is older she keeps saying since 7 years but i also dont want to offend her she hates when i mention « old » and demands i say « young » to her
[10.10.2023, 18:29:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Basically ja. Anyway im thinking too much contingency dont get manipulated and save my ass thank you 🙏🤍❤️
[10.10.2023, 18:32:26] Marco Luca Hefti: Or at least dont falsly charge me no desire to call anyone out. Just on the pursuit of happyness while being super moral and philantropic and horny since no lady wants me o go out with me exept my sweety who was very hard to convince. Well adhd and whatever
[10.10.2023, 22:13:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Thomas has not spoken a word but exactly at 22:00 he cane in loud lights on and now he is in a small talk conversation i with asier in kitchen i can hear with arm over ear.

What a sad coincidence timewise he knows i always try ro slewp 22:00 Uhr unlucky
[11.10.2023, 06:33:25] Marco Luca Hefti: A mosquito woke me up at ~3:00 very rare not had one in weeks/months.
[11.10.2023, 06:34:50] Marco Luca Hefti: -sleepy clicked « addiphone » popup « ok » in the morning  by mistake but checked no new iphone in apple id account. Strange popup
[11.10.2023, 13:03:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor last meet showed me two AI generated pictures one mountain with snow where the snow subtly formed soenthing like « Biörn » (i guess some name maybe a friend of victors) « gay »

And a ice cake where the chocokale icing/juce on the cake formed the word « nigger » according to Victor. But i did not really see it it was very subtle if at all. The « gay » thing was however quite visible if you knew what you are looking at at the slow mountain.

Not sure why he showed me maybe he had a little fun with his friends or more likely tested how i react since it seems a bit homophobic/rassistic but personally if there id no hate i would not and i have not made judgements or anything about victors character.

I am no pc police but i dont think those jokes all too funny  but im not judging. I guess im kinda neutral and he did not insult me by those i think so. Ja. Also even if i would not really be able to defend myself from insults now would i think it is worth it to react.

But i think it was just a little fun. Just wanned to mention it in case it was some kind of test for me or something
[11.10.2023, 13:04:47] Marco Luca Hefti: Went to get some presents or prep for lover for a suprise because i feel a bit better and altho i have stuff to do and should do other things she keeps jirpibg about it 🦢 🎶 for ages and i did put a considerable amount of time however i could do much better if i had better focus/timemmanagement by working memory
[11.10.2023, 14:05:51] Marco Luca Hefti: I bought presents for Gracie. Also a nice card and cancles.
[11.10.2023, 16:13:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Losing massive amounts of time by chatGPT website not being as snappy or even normal at all for the recent time when i had to do many RAV Bewerbungen and such. it somethimes just deletes what i effortfully wrote over 5-15 minutes and other times waits 2 mintues before responding when it usually does in 2 seconds.
[11.10.2023, 16:19:11] Marco Luca Hefti: does not load the website just does not load at one spesific chat for like 3 minutes just blank page and even releading is really slow hard to work
‎[11.10.2023, 17:03:56] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[11.10.2023, 17:04:53] Marco Luca Hefti: all websites i use to work on RAV stuff seem laggy or not work. No disk clean no browser cash delete. No update. No restart no antirvirus seems to do much. Usually it is way faster. It takes somethimes 3 minutes for something that takes 5 seconds usually and it is variable.
[11.10.2023, 19:27:32] Marco Luca Hefti: focus difficulties
[11.10.2023, 19:42:24] Marco Luca Hefti: AI tools Dont work i would have sent 200 Bewerbungen by now
‎[11.10.2023, 20:04:04] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[11.10.2023, 20:07:09] Marco Luca Hefti: I have nothing open i restarted the pc only 1 tap the website does not work. Or extremly slow lik someone fucks with me
[11.10.2023, 20:07:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Which is pretty much what i think is happening all the coincidences always happen when i try to apply for work
[11.10.2023, 20:08:01] Marco Luca Hefti: But surely it is just one of the billion coincidences
‎[11.10.2023, 20:13:33] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎video omitted
[11.10.2023, 20:29:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Everything perfectly quiet would be perfect for sleep. Once i go to sleep i hope it stays like this.
[11.10.2023, 20:42:22] Marco Luca Hefti: Wrote a bunch of people that i usually keep up to date about the application process:

« Ich hätt scho 5x mehr Bewerbige gschriebe wenn AI website funktioniere würd. Komischerwis funktioniere si wenn i mi bewerbe will viel viel schlechter, reagiere nid, oder extrem langsam zum teil erst in Minute was sunst Sekunde bruche würd teils reagiere sie gar nid. Egal welle browser oder reload oder was au immer. Das passiert sunst nid. Ich benutz die s ganze Johr. » ‎<This message was edited>

[12.10.2023, 11:27:57] Marco Luca Hefti: replairing watch

time goes by especially with regular meals and the website is snappyer so i can still do things but prob not for long
[12.10.2023, 11:28:25] Marco Luca Hefti: however it would be normal to be better

[12.10.2023, 13:12:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Not everyone but a bunch
‎[12.10.2023, 14:49:37] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[12.10.2023, 14:50:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Applying work not bad for the  disaster with websites yesterday still kinda distracted focus problems
[12.10.2023, 14:51:17] Marco Luca Hefti: :) but normal like alwas predictable(/stable) how it is Dose adhd med wise
[12.10.2023, 15:37:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Really confident, really intelligent Ladys really mysterious but deep down good that is actually really a attractive character for a Lady. There are many beautiful unique characters i guess.
[12.10.2023, 15:38:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Slightly kinky. Distracted by that currently back to work
[12.10.2023, 15:40:54] Marco Luca Hefti: Am i attracted to psychapathic Ladys? Does YouTube show me that add because of that? Maybe im a super empath and those go together with Psychopathic Genious Ladys xD That would be really, funny, romantic and scary. Most distraction thoughts usually go more towards current life though.
[12.10.2023, 15:41:31] Marco Luca Hefti: At least some YT vid sad s empath whatever not even sure if that is a clinical mainstream scientific term.
[12.10.2023, 15:42:10] Marco Luca Hefti: or d empath whatever
[12.10.2023, 15:42:56] Marco Luca Hefti: The last 6 texts should be ignored. I guess i just wrote them down to get them out of my head.
[12.10.2023, 15:47:24] Marco Luca Hefti: Random unusual ADHD thought: If a genius Lady would be on my ass then i would feel bad for running i guess. But medication that makes you forget stuff. Maybe investigative is not really helping keeping details of the past reliably at any moment.
[12.10.2023, 15:48:23] Marco Luca Hefti: running/doing stuff without being a gentleman
[12.10.2023, 15:48:58] Marco Luca Hefti: classical genteleman stereotype 1980 1950 maybe idk
[12.10.2023, 15:50:08] Marco Luca Hefti: I think its more a feeling thing cant remember/gotta look into it

[13.10.2023, 11:24:43] Marco Luca Hefti: Showered
[13.10.2023, 14:41:49] Marco Luca Hefti: PC feels strange. Even windows programms lagg. Feels kinda hacked even with antivirus but it is a good one. Norton so maybe some illegal stuff under the name of the possible fake investigation. But who knows. Probably just rare lag. I mean it can happen just did increase in frequency recently the lagg.
[13.10.2023, 16:10:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Gf is erradic first very sweet then angry but nothing unusual it was way more in the past and grateful to have anyone at all without adhd meds or by non psychoatrist V.M. Treatment
[13.10.2023, 16:13:59] Marco Luca Hefti: -Got mail from Post Box
-the usual Equasim Refil
-then Motorcycle
[13.10.2023, 16:15:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Now for the motorcycle i guess i can get the earpods to lern smth from pi.

[13.10.2023, 18:04:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad called about key searching and Julien Work and how much Applications i could send and i tole him of pablo Livio walk/film Motorcycle he said things i should/ or i guess « could » do asking me where the key is and i told him how to get i got inside to check and so on.

He said « sträng/stress » but also good it seemed. Idk

He was in public transport i did Video call for a bit. Long convo.

I said all good but lots lots to do and that im focusing on work and not changing meds. And being Zuftiden/Content with that and just do acceptable/normal things i said.

Very much consistant he said to meet grandparents again i said i recently was and they are busy and grampa still Leisten damage or whatever.
[13.10.2023, 20:10:53] Marco Luca Hefti: lower drive
[13.10.2023, 20:47:44] Marco Luca Hefti: brain not the best probably sleep and 40 Eq and boredom hard to say did not got my brilliance more like a dude with blocked brain and systematically idk.... or maybe just no normal ADHD treatment simple. First ADHD treatment im kinda idk then brilliant then get my brain up to speed but meds drop to 0 then no treatment crawling my way up then treatment not really then non psychiatrist and strange 4 years
[14.10.2023, 07:26:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Some mindfullness staying bed should not stay more than 6:50 tho
[14.10.2023, 10:44:47] Marco Luca Hefti: «blut spender » truck on claraplatz that happens maybe every 1-2 years just as Victor M. (my médical peer) wanted blood tests. I should make a blood test routune for cancer and imother stuff again somethime i guess
‎[14.10.2023, 10:54:31] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[14.10.2023, 11:43:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Gym trainer did friendly smile - Rare.
Maybe my voice more sympathic
[14.10.2023, 13:15:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Barely feel ever so slightly Gaslighted somethimes.
[14.10.2023, 14:29:27] Marco Luca Hefti: It said 6er Tram comes in 1 minute for 4 minutes and trams stood still guess some communication with headquarters maybe a Schiene was not set or the tram had to wait for scedulibg reasons. Slightly rare.

Well bad luck because i forgot my med at home so, but i will just in time make it and Victor said i can experiment with taking it later anyway (so instead of 30 minutes i could take it 45-60 minutes later for example. 14:50 instead of 14:30 for example
[14.10.2023, 14:48:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Washing clothes

[14.10.2023, 15:10:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Feeling like always. Recently. Honestly ok. I did do some things that where motivated. Right now i feel positive effects of the 40 Equasim i guess i will delay 40 equasim by 15 minutes like Victor said and see if it improves things eather because it might and not be important or because it just is or because ill follow his advice (even optional) advice like a 😇 patient so noone can tell me i did not.

Sry for long explanation. Me listening back to this or people that read
[14.10.2023, 17:04:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Listening to audiobook recommended by my AI service / browser. Doing to do list stuff prioritizing what i should do.
[14.10.2023, 19:43:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Here is how i draft some good night texts with tools and such:

"Good Night Gracie Hoang Trang,

As the night comes i hope you enjoy your parfums and clean tidy place. Ill send you a good night kiss and hope your sheets and pillows are as soft and sweet as you are. Good health to your family and i am looking forward to our next meet where i gift you some presents i got for you and we can enjoy sex.

Sleep well. :-*"

I am not sure what to think completely but it seems to be a good text balancing being cordial because eventho she can be maximally naughty and even enjoy squirting and demand to be fucked hard and roleplay r*p* and enjoy that which many woman do i guess but some hate both ive been told. However she also tells me conflicting things depending on if she is horny or feeling save or other things. Anyway somethimes it is extreamly hard to know why she is horny and happy and not and she always goes exactly after i cum 3 times and refuses to be licked or made to cum as if she was not allowed to and told to come for exactly 3 cums while she also does not seem very much emotionally engaged at all.

I hope she is sincere since a sideffect is that she is in my room alone, gets many info about me and also that she demands i date or attemtp no dating of anyone and firecly screams and does insane anger about this but then she also tells me casually totally changed and almost normal i could date ladys "if i dont miss younger ladys" first she said it many times and if i said anything but strong disagreement she would explode and no sex for weeks and starve me and so on and make me write insanely long text and do things i hate then other times she does not react much as if she suddenly does not find it so bad anymore, almost like she trained me to react a certain way where i would have reacted differently and she even demands I lye about certain things like how old she is or smth like that. I know what to say to not make her upset by now i guess.

[15.10.2023, 11:47:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Condolated for the death of the mother of Rebeccas Friend. And so on. Made timeplan how to work on things int he remaining time of this Sunday.
[15.10.2023, 12:07:40] Marco Luca Hefti: Do not feel super great and somethimes when i fear X or Y a bit ill might make sure ill show smth for that this may lead to some slight change in how good or bad a chat appears but i told people and i said many things before and even outside of whatapp i write a bunch so it should be protocolled only a wuick look without context or a cherry picked context would easily be distorted but thats normal… even with all the and and complexity
[15.10.2023, 12:08:54] Marco Luca Hefti: The temperature dropped a bit recently or maybe because i took more walks and ran i might be a tiny bit cooler

[15.10.2023, 13:16:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Good News my hon decided she wants to meet. 😍🤤🥰

I sleept not much the last two days by coincidence and i was woken up by coincidence at 3:40 in the morning by roomate today. By coincidence my gf wants to meet today. But it should be fine she only comes for 1 cum tho. :) And she said she even wants to cum 1 herself usually she refuses/blocks me or resists as much as she can from making me make her cum. Really happy i see my sexy Maus 13:14 15.10.2023 so now i have to clean and wash so i might have less time for the stuff i planed

Call Grossmami - Keeping this as the first task as it might be quick and a good start to the day.
Call RAV - To prepare for tomorrow's meeting with RAV Ochoa.
Respond to Mami wegen Reise.
Buy Rasierbesen (shaving brush) and possibly the juggling bags.
Call the pharmacy for Vitamin D and prescription inquiries.
Enter the birthday dates of people.


Like preparing for the Ochoa RAV meeting.
[15.10.2023, 13:19:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Roomates unluckely also decided to wash just now so i will have to deal with that and it will take much longer
[15.10.2023, 13:19:33] Marco Luca Hefti: and more time of me even less time to prepare RAV Meeting which i obviously did 1 day before (somethimes not at all) becuase of ADHD which is logical
[15.10.2023, 13:23:08] Marco Luca Hefti: 1 cum a week is better than 0 and i mean i might be 30 train and on the lookout for girlfriend since im small but somethimes im just unlucky and instead of 7x 5x a week or more it is 1 time every 3 weeks. There are people with only 1 leg so life can be harder. Im grateful for my sexy.
‎[15.10.2023, 13:24:07] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[15.10.2023, 13:27:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Still unlucky because i have a very high libido and noone had less sex than me noone maybe since im 26 i have more than 25% of you g people but not sure. Ultra mega unlucky some jave dex all the time that are not even that much trying. 
 well - withheld adhd medication probably main culprit and super unlucky with school and people somehow seeming not so into me as if someone told them some bs which is just adhd and my lack of confidence and sexdrive which then sowmthimes is very high variable
[15.10.2023, 13:27:37] Marco Luca Hefti: I guess

[15.10.2023, 13:29:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Usually way less and quick
[15.10.2023, 13:31:46] Marco Luca Hefti: Asked Thomasz if it can dry after the top he said imhe uses the drying tack like always anyway. 
And that its not his but Asiers Clothes below. I guess both washed at the same time
[15.10.2023, 13:34:18] Marco Luca Hefti: The top one Asier the bottom one thomasz if i understood correctly mistyped.
[15.10.2023, 13:35:49] Marco Luca Hefti: I forgot that this gentleman has a wife still and looks better now and got helped out and can do stuff with his family. So thats really heartwarming ☺️
[15.10.2023, 13:36:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Man that dude really has a awesome psychology inspirational pic of mine
[15.10.2023, 13:48:51] Marco Luca Hefti: RAV meet tomorrow at 14:30 exactly when i take Equasim so it means that the time im droping in bloodlevels would be 30 min after luckely i did not extend that time. Unluckely the meeting exactly starts at the worst point possible. Man unlucky. I guess i could have planed and prepared in advance like a non ADHD or treated person to counteract that. To be fair i could have just not have ADHD when i did that all the time. Obviously i knew if i had thought of it. Not the worst i think
[15.10.2023, 13:49:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Since he is back from holyday it also was only possible in this range of days to scedule a meet. I guess but not the time probably
‎[15.10.2023, 13:54:59] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[15.10.2023, 13:55:44] Marco Luca Hefti: called grandma 3-4 times over last 3 hours coud not reach her
[15.10.2023, 14:40:04] Marco Luca Hefti: I dont need hon to come tomorrow when she does not stay until 3 at night and get angry when i even dare to suggest sleep
[15.10.2023, 14:44:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Had those situations before not writing out every contingency it takes a lot of effort and is not easy as ADHD with non standard very unusual treatment  im not sure is optimizing for good or whatever. Somethimes gotta have algorythms that automatically guess dosages based on text and methods. Really simple just give me a few experts and money and ill design it i could do it when i was small. I told everyone how to do it but people not interessted or smart enought to understand. Well some exeptional ones are. Well who knows all comes anyway so soon those things will be not as actuall anymore but i got lots of other stuff or potential once i get my mental health and complex whatever in order and can focus on cool stuff instead of worries, paperworks and overly scared psychiatrist or whatever thinking im crazy or something. :D
[15.10.2023, 14:44:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Good prep on clean
[15.10.2023, 14:53:30] Marco Luca Hefti: /when E.F. does not work and u do intrincially short A.E.O. things with low time preference aka u game but even there it is just less of a ADHD thing becuase of the way dopamine noradrenalin and complex systems work. Russel Barkley phd https://youtu.be/YSfCdBBqNXY?t=5592  perfect time stamp 30 seconds
[15.10.2023, 14:56:51] Marco Luca Hefti: https://youtu.be/EH6gxG5DuTc?si=0U0RMI8uSFmQ4_fW
[15.10.2023, 15:14:24] Marco Luca Hefti: Easyer to clean. Some dosages id have a lot more trouble thinking about the purpose of life before every clean 🧹 🧼 before gf came over also my getting depressed fat and low libido and my gf seeming like she played or set me up or made me do stuff or whatever did not help also some people claiming they do bad things under mantle of investigation and « testing my reactions » a dubble game so to say did kot help but hard to remember last 4 years seemed to fuck up my memory at some points. Almost like when it gets better and i wanna change my life maybe idk.

Well adhd meds and memory. I know i just wanna life my life and im the most honest upstanding persion exept jesus and all the other people for my extreamky tought life xD oh and i get blamed like i was having a great time and doing holyday.

So its the best of both worlds. Get all the blame and 0 recognition and fight like a beast to do simple stuff with ur non medicated severe adhd brain or whatever injury or whatever might have happened who knows. 

Definitly nothing natural as in injury maybe surgery or smth but probably all fine. Just the meds but ja.

Somethimes peoples reaction gaslighting and lawyers or doctors seeming like they know u based on ur prejudgemwnt makes u think.
[15.10.2023, 15:16:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Anyway. Happy days im doing stuff and gf comes she did not meet much recently butive been feeling a lot better and able to work decently. Grateful and i am not changing med like my Therapist suggested strongly.

Just worried if does is suboptimal it might burn me out and i will be in a dillemma but so far no reason to belive. All good im doing what im supposed to. Im just reminded of being more contingecy mode whenever tiny red faggs happen like hard to explain. Its nothing is better otherwise im paranoid ur damed if you do damed if you dont.
[15.10.2023, 15:17:33] Marco Luca Hefti: But so far all people told me all is great. Not great but solid and way better and nice go keep going and such.

Thats good enough for me after my life!!!
[15.10.2023, 15:18:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Gonna work and so on.
[15.10.2023, 15:30:02] Marco Luca Hefti: I wrote a bit long Rebecca maybe the low sleeo and medication timing is getting to me a bit
[15.10.2023, 15:31:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Unluckly roomates showered and i woke up. They seemed resonantly quiet when i was awake maybe just coincidentally low sleep phase could checj the watch is always on my body and the app
[15.10.2023, 15:40:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Asier mentioned i closed the door a bit to forcefully. I think i barely did ja not sure thonsound was quite quiet. I apologized and explained lower sleep woken up by noice but ja. Otherwise i was just friendly but a bit « thank you for taking it out » like not as « ja take as long as you want » i guess i was friendly for sure i listened closely to myself but not as non stressed and zen like relaxed as a perfect marco could be 100% but way less than someone who would write me his text. Its not exxaggerated
‎[15.10.2023, 15:42:18] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[15.10.2023, 15:42:55] Marco Luca Hefti: Last two text overexplained but cant think everything through with my E.F. level so i just write more to « be on the safe s. side ». ‎<This message was edited>
[15.10.2023, 15:47:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Gf seems a tiny bit more like a angel some months even when angry. Dont wanna generalize tho. But i can remember c r a z y times. V. said she seems bipolar. Dont think so i said im grateful and somethiems i agreed 😅 but i knew i was magically in a very very bad spot with the med sideeffects and u lucky timings of med dose cha ges maybe. Maybe i always switched in bad moments upwards and in good moments downwards or somethint solidifying problematic patterns or so idk. 🤷‍♂️
[15.10.2023, 16:03:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Asier stood Dryer opened to take out the dust and turn it on again like we periodically do wanned to check time. Went back a few minutes early he still was standing there barely doing anything it seemed the dust was still full, but when i suprised asked "Oh already done?" He said "Ya." So i Dont have to check the time anymore since the dryer is done. I thought there is 30 min left or something. Can take long when it is so full. 16:03 always talks with his mom on his headset in kitchen in spanish.
[15.10.2023, 16:04:43] Marco Luca Hefti: finished his masters he said proudly i congratulated him
[15.10.2023, 16:05:34] Marco Luca Hefti: So many doctors and mastersstudents not all but many since the educational institutes are here and the pharama is not far. Good connection nice central place.
[15.10.2023, 16:07:01] Marco Luca Hefti: notepad frozen since a while rest computer works smooth nothing frozen
[15.10.2023, 16:20:22] Marco Luca Hefti: gf told me she can come tomorrow but i already cleaned and i hate cleaning without super meds and it takes long with my workingmemory so today is fine also she cancles often after some time its very variable also when i want to change anything even slightly she often cancles just from that and gets bad mood and punishes me. Currently she is different

[15.10.2023, 16:32:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Really want to a normal adhd psychiatrist and not a novice with high IQ where im not sure about intensions to say it mildly 😣
‎[15.10.2023, 16:35:32] Marco Luca Hefti: ‎image omitted
[15.10.2023, 16:36:54] Marco Luca Hefti: The radiator is only on 2/3 1/2 recently before it was warmer. Now i even close the windows too cool only somethimes
[15.10.2023, 16:45:44] Marco Luca Hefti: When i put powersaver mode and go eat or do things often it is gone when im back i Dont know why it always stops there used to be times where it just stayed and i even tried to fix it with gpt guidance and also by calling a Microsoft affiliated place long ago, but deadends. Also told peope at pc stores but its super hard to carry pc there and takes hours and days extreamly pain full and i have nothng for super long and usually i gotta do stuff or i have nothing else since peope refuse to give me a normal ADHD psychiatrist that is not prechosen or even prechosen one. Frau Rohmeder said "I cant swtich you i am not allowed to." Investigation what are you gona do. Since everybody is lying and gaslighting me suposidly for investigation or whatever im fucked. Discussting but guess no justice force in the world that cant deal with a high iq police corruption small cell and then some family beign drawn in by "your in it now play or we have stuff on you" things.
[15.10.2023, 16:47:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Man i should have been born in the USA at the right county at least they seem to have less of that but who knows. Well it is probably nothing right since i gotta concider 200 things and no matter what i do i run into some issues or things i do wrong. Eeather i wrote too much or am too worried or not worried enought and shuold have prepared or smth.
[15.10.2023, 16:50:59] Marco Luca Hefti: The electricity consumption of a PC can vary significantly depending on its specifications and workload. Generally speaking, a high-performance gaming PC could consume between 300-500W when running at full power, whereas an average office PC might consume around 100W. Balanced mode in Windows 11 aims to provide a balance between performance and power consumption, which could reduce the power draw to some extent, but the exact figures are difficult to predict without specific hardware information.

In a 3-person household, the electricity consumption from other appliances like refrigerators, air conditioning, lighting, etc., could easily range from a few kWh to many kWh per day. Considering that:

A high-end PC running at full power for 13 hours could consume approximately 6.5 kWh (500W * 13 hours).
In balanced mode, if it consumes 70% of the full power, that could be around 4.55 kWh (350W * 13 hours).
The PC's share of daily electricity use in this case could range from relatively small to substantial, depending on total household consumption.

If your household's daily consumption is about 30 kWh, the PC at full power would account for approximately 21.7% (6.5/30 * 100), while in balanced mode, it would account for about 15.2% (4.55/30 * 100).

Since the PC isn't running continuously, its actual contribution would be less. If it runs sporadically within that 13-hour window, you'd adjust these numbers accordingly.


Son basically no difference nothing that could make it "significant" I mean it would be nice to have i would be happy to ask family but they seem to always have something to do and cant really help. Im always scolded when i do. I can do it just needs time and i have way way way more urgent things to do.

To maximize efficiency:

Enable sleep mode when not in use.
Turn off unnecessary peripherals.
Use energy-efficient settings.
[15.10.2023, 16:54:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Some apps are quite fast right now nice lets see how long it lasts
[15.10.2023, 16:58:22] Marco Luca Hefti: I forgot the sheets i set a timer but maybe i missed it since i made other timers guess i gotta remember to always read and not just most if the time or a peoblem with timers at the same time
[15.10.2023, 16:58:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Or slightly wrong time. Or i got distracted after
[15.10.2023, 16:59:30] Marco Luca Hefti: And forgit what was in my immediate plans. Im doing better but there is still a lot of room for improvement.

But good enought. If things play fair ill be totally fine
[15.10.2023, 17:29:27] Marco Luca Hefti: got some food in
[15.10.2023, 17:51:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Something in my brain just felt nice kinda like schauder but localized right side slihtly towards back of top.
[15.10.2023, 17:51:35] Marco Luca Hefti: happened maybe second time. Felt a bit like a knot lifting or idk feels good only short felt
[15.10.2023, 17:52:26] Marco Luca Hefti: -I loove the progress im making right now really motivating to keep going to remember some things i am motivated for later.
[15.10.2023, 18:12:59] Marco Luca Hefti: -got all hands full cant ask V or check the medication data already asked many times hope it comes got reminder but ja low prio since worries of other contingencys and dont wanna reizen
[15.10.2023, 18:16:14] Marco Luca Hefti: -If one wanted to they could move the roomates around to "help" Marco back and forth they would be annoyed and move out since no time to deal with it then i would have massive paperwork and the right place would be free so all controllable. But obviously pure contingency 0% likelyhood. Just get this out on endless log. 18:16
[15.10.2023, 19:06:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Showered
[15.10.2023, 19:16:22] Marco Luca Hefti: I became wiser.

-Dont annoy Gagamel.
-Get out of way.
-Work maybe u slip away when attention shifts and smth else more interessting.

-Be a good Schlumpf as in social or just part of them.
-Dont be stamped.

Bat says smart things. Or other good stuff.
Dont steal spotlight when Gagamel feels like being in it.
U can do stuff but only when not getting in way or (when spotted and G. feels like kinda work for G. somethimes good somethimes bad conditions somethimes kinda for free and not so cool stuff if it cant be done better.)
[15.10.2023, 19:20:37] Marco Luca Hefti: or i reembered how to behave better

[16.10.2023, 11:56:18] Marco Luca Hefti: I will start voting when i got a normal adhd treatment from someone that does not seem suspect. So far i never had that exept when i was small and there it worked great for some time especially when i was small in some aspects.

I did never have a normal girlfriend. My life is absolutely dogshit. Many normal things like friends or a normla head or organisation. I have no time to vote im only 1 person the perople who are lucky can eather help adhd or stalked people or not complain.

I dont want to vote without being informed
[16.10.2023, 11:59:28] Marco Luca Hefti: V. once told me it was some sign of anything surely that is bad faith or the people that decide that fired.

But who cares not gonna mess with anyone even if they are totally on the wrong path i amnit in a position to do so and kinda lost the believe in law&order/justicesystem i can understand crime way better corruption or insane mishandling obvious makes it way more understandable.

But tuff on crime people see
 To often not understsne and are probably the enabling factor for it indirectly.
[16.10.2023, 12:25:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Sec. lover cane for 1 hour yesterday and left exactly **:59 and she was a bit cool in the end but warm and sexy before. I want a lover than can spend more time on me than 1 hour/meet ever 1-4 weeks and has the way higer libido of mine. Feels like im being played but who knows.

Ill just make up for it later with being very high libido when i wiuld have been normal to slightly high

[16.10.2023, 14:33:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Ich würde gern ADHS Orgnaisationsmässig und rechtlich mal anschauen ob ich da genügend abgesichert bin und was ich machen würde wenn zb die RAV oder eine Stelle irgend etwas einfach nicht macht. Oder ist es genug/ok einfach die Eltern zu fragen? Nicht das jetzt etwas konkretes wäre was ich gerade machen wollte aber ich bin auch voll beschäftigt und habe keine Zeit und auch keine Lust mich mit irgend jemandem Legal anzulegen einfach nur falls ich muss weil es mir zb nicht erlabt ist einen normal ADHS Psychiater zu haben oder die RAV mich wegen einer Kleinigkeit ablehnt obwohl ich mit vollem Einsatz dran bin einfach wegen ADHS zb. Oder so Sachen. 

Es ist eine Frage für allgemein/Zukunft welche wir noch nie wirklich besprochen haben. 🤔

[17.10.2023, 07:32:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Asier seems to talk very little now. When i felt better and had more motivation drive and entusijasm it was way easier to talk now every talk feels fake and doomed to fail and my brain just shut off as to gove up on communication before it even starts.

I could talk but idk maybe just normal but of course since my adhd meds arr not normal and the treatment non standard probably or i have narrow med range who knows

Kinda like model 18 and out of taste my age. So the only thing would be to increase the age to 29-22 but not sure hrd to guess age.

Age guesser some seem super young and are suprisingly old and vice versa
[17.10.2023, 15:42:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Kinda paranoid about setups i guess since even bad evidence can be stretched and cherrypicked

He said when asked if a normal person would be faster at a orking on the letters and things i had that i was less rushed seeming and looking less at the time while doing things.

I said that i feel slow but better able to do things.

I mostly worked on the post and forms called about overdue Taxes who have a risk of 1-2 tousand when not done in time sucessfully moved date. ‎<This message was edited>

Im not complaining just trying to do good things like working and acting in a way where everyone would agree im definitly being super.... brav and just credible.

[19.10.2023, 19:36:07] Marco Luca Hefti: She said she mistyped my number and is in holydays in france Lyon and philipines so i guess just coincidence she seemed to want to stop talking and just apologize for messaging me. She mentioned something that she messaged me before but mistake
[19.10.2023, 19:38:09] Marco Luca Hefti: She said she thinks she messaged me before by mistake. Maybe my number is similar or maybe just some setup for some bs like i somethimes feel someone is trying to set me up but just coincidence i guess
[19.10.2023, 19:38:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Thinking of how my hon used to meet me way more and it has gradually declined at points and is soooo low we barely almost never meet anymore Man… i should make mail but it sucks im being starved ‎<This message was edited>

[20.10.2023, 17:44:46] Marco Luca Hefti: Anxiety
[20.10.2023, 17:45:25] Marco Luca Hefti: Cant think what the next step to do is in sending motivationsschreiben wasting so much time with brain not remembering the next step in plan (working memory) im otherwise totally normal and calm tho

[21.10.2023, 09:00:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Haven't really spoken about dad pizza in kitchen. He said "Dont look at me" when i just am thinking and stare into nothing. Annoying when he does that gets me out of concentration. He did that the last two meets noone else does that. Said my gf play with me and u don't give money do you? I said no only super rare overall years its balanced definitly not unusual. What he thinks i spend in total he did not answer. Lots of question no answer eventho they talked. Much trivial matters and normal talk everytthing normal that is just a small part of a much longer conversation. Had issues with app had to go back multible times but did not have to wait long guess im not the only one with tech issues some of the time. Nice meet overall bit idk seemed a bit smth its almost choreographed how some things go when meds whent low when we drive back he kinda says things gaslighting/annoyingly and then he does it until i react and slightly raise my tone a snit bit and also match his then normal again. Would be able to be taken out of context but ja. Said family stuff is fine im not tring to accuse anyone told multible times over the years or life i think but worried he might think he got to do stupid things to prevent smth. But ja very low %
[21.10.2023, 09:02:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Losing time with thinking and not going for things and doing them fast and confident but too "cant remeber" "not sure" kidna thing. But better than nothing im doing stuff. Just ADHD present
[21.10.2023, 09:02:12] Marco Luca Hefti: etc complex
[21.10.2023, 11:34:33] Marco Luca Hefti: gf seems to not read the text but demand large ones? hm noticed a bunch maybe she busy idk

[21.10.2023, 13:48:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Man im somethimes confused about my life. But it could be that im just super ADHD and whatever. In thoughts of possibilitys just wanna do right by people especially when its important but hard without ADHD meds that help with that. Also i got really good moral foundation not perfect but it would help to have more trusting / interessted / people like me to discuss in order to improve it. The strengh seems to be that it is also working besides intuition. So even if it would not be there i could reason. Got really strong ability to do so. However kinda hit diminishing returns. Guess better time and task management and doing things and friends and all would help my brain then i could implement and while doing so refine since implementation can change a moral foudnation just as much.
[21.10.2023, 13:48:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Anyway....
[21.10.2023, 13:48:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Just a sidething.
[21.10.2023, 14:13:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad was once visiting a presentation of a friend of his he supported that was for solarmodul and pointed out "war <-> petrol" whatever and he was not sure about 9/11 back in the day i was young and i promised to give a open mind to everything for intellectual honestly. So i watched the university professor with my dad who was having a 100 man largest solarpannel bussiness very Pflichtbewusst successful bussinessman in my eyes right so i then figured out the logical fallacys and burden of proof and raising questions not enought and also techniques and patterns that can be used to make such 9/11 truther videos quite sophisticated at times, add to that untreated ADHD and a really strange complex and hard life and depression something where i was kinda driving towards, is something wrong? Is this really real life just all bad laws and coincidence or might there really be people who would do smth like that to further geopolitical goals i never said its true i just was giving it some depressed (well YouTube also put it down everyones throat the algorythm based on machine lerning). So i am *NOT* a 9/11 truther and have not watched a 9/11 video since like ~13 years ago or smth idk and i was never someone that was convinced just was annoyed by people not engaging in argument or dismissing with very bad ones while being super arrogant about it. Well. Just in case "Daniel Ga." was mentioned in speach with dad or smth. To prevent misrepresentation. Eventho logally you would think that would not happen my life seems full of false accussations and misrepresentations. Or people reaching premature judgements seemingly.
[21.10.2023, 14:15:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad kinda made donations for renewable energy future and sponsored some stuff for sport for children in the basel region and such stuff i think but Dont know does not say many things just tradition
[21.10.2023, 14:16:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Always seen honest and upstanding never said a bad word and basyan probabalistic hypothesis can be done about many things and ja I already wrote this in past daily journals so it is no new info obviously.
[21.10.2023, 14:23:19] Marco Luca Hefti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vclq2v6Z7PY

lerned some solarpro stuff maybe spend a hour or 40 minutes cant remember when i started. attention drifted often to "who the f should i cater to and how" but i know how to work within societys needs i think  more and more. But ja communicaiton can be hard. But I think mostly it is the ADHD and maybe little "fun freetime" that makes my mind be more distracted or worries maybe idk. Im feeling super normal just mind tends to distract with things that it thinks i should concider i guess. Would not write all since would look too weird to have any thought here a lot are already and also wanna not write info where people could not want it and that would be novel so. But myb cant even remember if the last category happened.
[21.10.2023, 14:23:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Ok so tried organisational stuff. Prepare for work things. Now Gym.
[21.10.2023, 15:12:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Had really good facial muscle control for short time seems to diminish. Also abs gespannt while breath relaxed. Hm maybe some willpower reserve dopamine nora conversion maybe? 🤔 🤷‍♂️
[21.10.2023, 15:12:44] Marco Luca Hefti: 40mg Equa not long ago. Hm… maybe i should take it a tiny bit later like victor said. 14:45 activated
[21.10.2023, 15:13:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Should i… 🧐🤔🤔🤔
[21.10.2023, 15:13:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Guess would also well V said optional

[21.10.2023, 16:18:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Some ~15 y old lady made picture in my direction with middle finger in front. I am sure just direction. Maybe studied her Ring or smth
[21.10.2023, 16:21:24] Marco Luca Hefti: My place is full with young and old people. 15y old maybe and younger and old and rarely a 40y old. Guess there is some school near here. Its not that that is what stands out what stands out is the seeming lack of people around my age. Guess they have all received adhd treatment and moved on to not be tortured and lead productive lifes instead of having to cave to i stinct as a means to reduce pain like biting nails or just having anxiety and brain not working and forgetful’ness.

[21.10.2023, 16:34:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Unvelivable a actual person that is maybe around my age and f. Wow. I did not think i ever seen one at my Gym after a few months or years
[21.10.2023, 16:36:43] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe not my type but wont say mildly positive since gf does not like eventh im so starved i might not even feel much attraction somethimes idk. When im motivated then less does not mean when im lazy then less somethimes
[21.10.2023, 16:37:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Lots of clickbait do nothing apps but fine « ask ai »

[21.10.2023, 17:15:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Just as I mention ~27y olds a few days ago a bit too many times maybe 😄 maybe because gf acts tiny uhm… well idk if i set up a trip and presents u go ibiza and meet me for 1 c not very passionate pokerface tiny more than usual. But just for contingency im kinda the sameish not very horny in fact i was very much not horny recently. Not even getting hard. About at the time of gf meet maybe i was satisfyed or stress or meds slightly too high which lead to now it reducing libido a tiny bit may fluctuate like up and down curve maybe just slow up and downs idk. stress 

The gym suddenly has some not my type but honestly still my type. hard to say when 24 if 15 some are really old or young looking contingency.

Me like 👍
[21.10.2023, 17:20:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Current gym trainer maybe subtly not so happy to see me. Never did anything bad to her tho :) but its just not too happy or idk. Or neutral probably that. ‎<This message was edited>

[24.10.2023, 12:02:55] Marco Luca Hefti: i am not burned out actually feeling normal and performant eventho it was a bit unsure maybe working and doing things and feeling burned out for a bit kinda helps you get into it. Ususally this "slack" period with some of the meds anyway.

Still writing it since currently the yt algorythm gave those vids. Im kot beliving that its just one of the many basyan hypothesis that change with evidence and such. Kinda like puzzle u can never see the picture but rule in or out some then add a pinch of not sure and u get at that oh and ad a pinch string adhd and few bad stuff since people dont belive u kinda fucked

Peobably just imagination but they seem not so gut zu sprechen altho they seem to not show any of it kinda look at me like « who are you » but very subtle probably nothign

[25.10.2023, 20:46:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe because i was recommended « narrissists corrupt pple against u behind ur back » videos saying such stuff recently and some people exibit and have even told me directly such things

[26.10.2023, 11:50:44] Marco Luca Hefti: maybe social does help with ADHD meds effectiveness
[26.10.2023, 14:27:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Concerned of provcy but im used to it. Any counter intelligence and anti corruption or agency that is out to only protect and not protect me from myself or « also » protect me can have full access to all whatsapp logs ai ever write daily journals
[26.10.2023, 14:30:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Not sayibg that is the case. Just somethimes stuff feels a bit like … u know no accussation to anyone but i have been falsely accused or tried to trick into bad stuff a bunch over my life. Like the dudes with the drug or ladys or other things so maybe that is why im extra careful eventhoug i would not be appaled by strongly regulated moderate save driverslicence similar mild drug use depending pn scientific evidence or like other places who have more lenient laws however i have not yet made  a opinion i would look ibto it before i have no decire i just want my life back with the right adhd treatment
[26.10.2023, 18:22:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Meeting Sascha old roommate currently in city
[26.10.2023, 18:25:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Did not let me pay just ket him would have taken longer i would seem strange to insist
[26.10.2023, 22:08:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Alufoil took some pizza home.
[26.10.2023, 22:32:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Visited Frieds was very plesant now that im ok/good again im grateful for that. Offered some ty help in checking in
[26.10.2023, 22:33:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Also really good to get more third person perspektives
[27.10.2023, 00:36:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Sascha has a two very fiendly wg mates eapecially the taller Madam with glasses blond who said its a long long time since she was 18 was very very friendly man Sacha went to his girlfriend after the nice evening. (He told me)

It is interessting how my libido can change so much since shortly before the 27y old ladys startet to appear it wS high but barely any ladys about my age where around in city gym etc now that i am a bit worked from lots of paperwork an maybe worries because some memories altho now im way better after the meet and more thinking i can be more relaxed i just overthink maybe.

But i am way more attached to my age than to unsurre if 18-17-16 

So ja.

But my friend is a bit sone maybe he got so little live that he now has died off of the 40 Equasim burned my libido a bit or it is. Up and down where it slowly accumulates or my sleep.

Anyway. Depending on meds im super hard or not so hard until i get hard then still normal.

When i was 20->30 and i was most motivated i was hogher libido as well from time to time.

My libido is not as much as a healthy one would be it is a bit week.

But i appreachate beautiful ladys so much that i have no problem ans it is okay/goos just not great i thill think i can make a gf deinitly happy since i also got my mouth and i am very muh brutally extremly starved since young and no adhd meds/the eight meds anymore a brutal torture even without nbasically no friends and even a chance i. Ladys it is really fucked up and it makes me reLly want to go extreame in terms of amount of normal sex the longer it goes on.
[27.10.2023, 00:39:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Hopefully i find a normal adhd pychiatriat soon and have fun in more subtle things as well like interpersonal/work/hobbie/planing/pursuit of things and so on then sex is less important and more the romance is smth im more able of right now i feel kinda more psychopathic/non feinfühlig/able to tune into the finer arts of human normalcy.

But its ok there it is not 0 just artificially below average.
[27.10.2023, 06:38:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Tiny bit redwhine with pizza while visiting people socially yeterday
[27.10.2023, 06:39:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Usually nothing protocoling a bit less and more reluctantly
[27.10.2023, 09:08:22] Marco Luca Hefti: Herr Dubach said they should not act like this its all fine and he « cant » give a Arztzeugnis for the first two weeks (not like it woule do all too much i got bugger issues and Herr Ochoa said its not a big deal just a Verwarnungen even if many Verwarnubgen i wont be kicked of just some reduction of days. But he did give me a Arztzeugnis the second time and said it was for this so i dont understsne completely why but ok. No big deal as long as stuff is fine i dont need to make a deal out of it maybe he was a tiny bit distracted after operation.
[27.10.2023, 09:08:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Speaking about 1-4 weeks ago
[27.10.2023, 09:26:24] Marco Luca Hefti: discomofort
slow writing
slow
the usual
[27.10.2023, 09:26:40] Marco Luca Hefti: still faster than in last 4 years exept some of the time when i was way faster
[27.10.2023, 10:25:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Called mom connection like a « walkie talkie antena phone» feom 1990 notmal phone wahstsapp video or normal call weatheris calm it is not raining and pretty the usual since today

Never have that usually technical stuff seems to have problems eventho im updating very frequently
[27.10.2023, 10:28:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Mom said she needs to make tax return and she does not want to verlänhern it when i said its fine until end of month she said its due she seems a bit whatever from her back insury and stress at work since technical difficulzshe said
[27.10.2023, 11:03:07] Marco Luca Hefti: raging ADHD i think but im so used to it i Dont see it and im isolated every time i try to meet people some family or corrpion (low likelyhood) (it  almost cant be a honest normal legal investigation only as cover in that low likelyhood) or what is most likely is just super mega ultra bad luck and a super mega raging ADHD and some super high drive/intelligence or some bs idk

its just insane how much working memory problems i have while sorting or doing s tuff i feel even my typoing seems slow
[27.10.2023, 11:06:58] Marco Luca Hefti: Asked mom (and lots of other people like psychiatrist and so on) that if i have 100 Bewerbungen but all in first week and 4 weeks then would rav have a problem with it they said no. I agree it would be ridiculous but even if the RAV dude clearly and repetedly told me it would not be a big issue at all. alos others say so it would make no sense if stuff was not fucked up. Just for contingency all is fine and im applying for work i hope. Just in case

[27.10.2023, 14:17:37] Marco Luca Hefti: gf said only 1 hour meet again. seems like torture and i got to do all the work also she had me do all the planing and so on seems like what would be done malitiously but coincidence that aligns witht he worth thing possible to have me stay single does not mean it is that. She seems busy makes sense on Halloween she seems not interssted in me or maybe she cant because she busy she is hard to understand makes little sense

Hat Optionen aufgezählt wie: bei Ihm zuhause, Fischer Haus, Messeplatz abmachen schin irgendwie etwas ruhig oder ka… bischen scary aber ja. Misuse of devoutly religious is kinda f*ed and so on or blackmail went on as things but what seemed most likely is pedo investigation for some report of out of context/selbstabzeige wegen einigem wegen Familie falls die irgendwie was haben. Should be no problem still scary. Or some marry or else thing or idk.

But ill justtreat it as going to talk about religion a bit and see a family member i have not seen in long. Eventho im agnostic moderat and not relly i vested mich in religious exept paying respect to the traditions, people that do and to eypose to wide range of believes etc or to contingency but would have done anyway. Probably fine. Man i worrie too much because of recent past but im kinda good now i did not worrie much since exept when i heared voice but im good but for contingency 😱

Man reputation attack is no joke velieve believe anything and lots of stuff gaslighting is also scary when u dont know why.
[27.10.2023, 18:12:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Gf said she meet snd because i did not respond fast enough she said now she wont come at all i work and so on a lot also meds slow also had call.

She does not care exept somethimes where she is totally different

[27.10.2023, 18:14:20] Marco Luca Hefti: I can remember when i was tortured by med sideffects and basically more and more fat depressed and her brutal rage not blaming her but she also made many strange special hardcore rules and i could not ask or had to lye or not many things then suddenly she does not care weird.
[27.10.2023, 18:15:24] Marco Luca Hefti: But guess maybe up down of emotions and me not being treated and not getting normal adhd psychiatrist maybe they knew how to get meds wuicker than 4-5 years i seem to be a low range of effectiveness dosage like it was said in website i was given

[28.10.2023, 15:32:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Meet Oncle Flurin. I think its always good to hear perspektives without premature judgements and thaie the best parts, intensions, strengths and in general win-win because under pretty much any opinion i could see some value others of other believes would hold to even if somethime was not even interessted or neutral. But its smth to find out and u can dive and lern about such over a long life and ja. So im not suddenly a fanatic i am a moderate agnostic that believes in what id true and good. And having tonns of sex and a awesome life even if kinda not a calm 1 sex a month marriage (nothing against marriage just has to not suck 😅) i think  that is a low bar otherwise why marry if u hate it and it is also not to have a bad time right? Isnt that respect for traditions?

I am i can marrie someone i am not into if i can otherwise have a great life without life fun destroying limits.

Also depends what people understand under religion different interpretations.

[29.10.2023, 14:35:47] Marco Luca Hefti: Diving a bit into the abstract:

I have renewed faith at least for now. Faith is that interessting, usefl, fun, reveiling things that make the journey worth it lay ahead i guess i enjoy interessting things as well not only the endless beauty of beautiful, intelligent and unique ladys. I remember that its very beautiful to be super capable and then wrestling with a Lady (more the testing/romance dance kinda like those swans or whatever just very intelligent humans sounds good, also being strong makes for good raising of child when super capable feeling and the « freedom u never know » stuff…. Also the philantropic things when u got lots of pushback guess i felt the more intricate and elaborate emotional ranges how beautiful.

But it might be nicer when u got the optimal range not some insurmountable crushing of ur abilitys. Guess it is the good old « play on more even ground or no fun wont play thing »

Not talking about contest interessting memorys of feels. May make little sence but im tring to describe emotions i guess.

Ah hm the « do it the natural way stuff » aka without but question is is it really better ‎<This message was edited>

[29.10.2023, 21:49:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Gracie said gd birthday nice aniversay and left seemed pretty carefree. Or barely any emotions. 🤷‍♂️🤔 Well.. not that non normal
[30.10.2023, 07:09:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Gf said good birthday good anniversary and left after seeming incincere and even when i said why not holm or do anything but lay and wait til time over and be totally emotionless she said some excuse then held me like and it seemed real but not really and then she just said those things no interesst in this she wanted me to plan and so on. Complex a bunch of hypothesis this is not thr first this this is happening for years now since the depressive/torture with medications from private person who is not a psychiatrist but so nice as to help me find meds however….. anyway dont wanna speculate and ill just wanna life my life i would not tell or try to uncover anything just leave me be. 

Anyway Gracie is playing smth she is basically almost triing to get some reaction. This is also what people that (totally clearly and directly) gaslighted me in the past before i lost my ability to remember or do anything since its not like going to 1 lawyer or police is soing anything at all.

Anyway i also have to be careful not to seem crazy. So everything is fine. Its all normal and teconcally there is plausable deniability in a vaccum to all actions just not the bigger picture but who knows. not the first time she is super nice/behaved compared to some periods in the past. She switches like a different person. Anyway. Just potocol contingency
[30.10.2023, 07:38:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Coincidently on the day that i would have to contact people before the month is over the internet does not seem to work so far.
[30.10.2023, 07:45:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Websites barely work they crawl like every click or thing to load takes ages.

[30.10.2023, 07:54:16] Marco Luca Hefti: I protocolled way more in the past recent months and years seem very similar to those in the past 4 years not sure but somethimes i feel like many events are almost identical like where i go and what people do and so on and i guess therefore also what i write int he logs but maybe less detailed

UPC wollte auf altes unsicheres Irgendwas umstellen damit ich "alle websiten erreichen kann" aber ich kann eigentlich alle websiten erreichen die komischen Probleme sind relativ neu und scheinen wege Fehlern oder anderem komischen Zeugs zu sein.

Internet did not work and one call and it basically instantly worked again. Of course it wasted a lot of time and made me have to write protocolls and not be able to work on money the day i would need to work more or be able to do things since people work again.

Langsam aber stetig. 🐌👍
Nein noch nicht, Habe an einigen Plätzen persönlich nachgefragt und geschrieben, leider noch keine Zusage.  (Habe aber eine Praxis welche mich bei Bedarf behandeln kann und bei Besuch die Hausarzt Gelegenheit besprechen kann.)"" The place said when i am suck or come for smth i can also discuss the Hausarzt thing. But hole family AI and everyone i asked including the Praxis places i was said it does not matter and is a quick thing so other important things priority.

[30.10.2023, 14:05:12] Marco Luca Hefti: anxiety for some reason im kinda almost unable to do work its like no matter what i do i have no anxiety exept when i do the useful stuff i urgently maybe have to do i get it and its not just full performance with anxiety it is a blackout with anxiety that dynamically vanishes and appeares based on seemingly the usefulness of the task i am tring to engage in almost like super inhuman human ML experiments but hey
[30.10.2023, 14:40:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Margarity LLausha or the other different UPC person all sounding not too exsessively old and resonably young asked me to click a link she would have sent to my iPhone that would have opened camera for me to make a picture  of some modem or cable/Steckdose did not want to click on link she also tried to switch IPV6 -> IPV4 and the other once already explained weeker security and old and so on. It seemed not nessesary so i did not click link as adviced a bunch over the years by random articles and such things or people or google and so on.

[30.10.2023, 17:33:06] Marco Luca Hefti: V spoke of people with muscle schwund is it ALS? I cant remember the past i got adhd and maybe Strattera made me able to remember. But i think its there not sure if even strattera does smth since  i do jot choose what i forget
[30.10.2023, 17:39:25] Marco Luca Hefti: If i was remembering why i strive for things like good reasons a good enought reason. I have trouble remembering
[30.10.2023, 17:39:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe that lowers drive
[30.10.2023, 17:39:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Hm maybe adhd meds are needed the right ones
[30.10.2023, 17:50:33] Marco Luca Hefti: I guess i mean personal experience. Maybe its a focus issue

[31.10.2023, 21:35:34] Marco Luca Hefti: Also Hausarzt i should write him he will get some place and we go togeher or smth also asked about Rohmeder and if i want to go to her or another ADHD psychiatrist and if i heared from prosolis or the other place i applyed to family askes me that like clockwork why would they be so focused on such details but ok. Also dad seemed to kinda talk as if he talk a tiny bit thought unterdrückte/moderated fletched teeth or some tiny anger also impactient when i tell stuff not very loving but maybe busy im not accusatory. :) Seems to be a general style of his.
[31.10.2023, 21:45:33] Marco Luca Hefti: Since Familys seem to do strange things and not bulge i just use AI since it "es ist mir zu blöd" to think of fitting messages myself and i wanna balance both perfectly and not get caut between two possible fronts.
[31.10.2023, 22:03:07] Marco Luca Hefti: This was one of the rare moments i wrote mom and dad with ai
[31.10.2023, 22:03:21] Marco Luca Hefti: But of course i decided

[01.11.2023, 08:51:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Since i think maybe some people think i need to change ill go to church eventho i barely have time or motivation to do things and i will neglegt other things also i am truly interssted eventho people always seem to make it really hard for me and not allow even 0.00000001% nouance. Also i am worried i say something wrong and they go crazy.
[01.11.2023, 08:51:52] Marco Luca Hefti: But ill probably do it anyway if i get the confidence which i absolutely seem to super mega struggle with.
[01.11.2023, 08:54:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Basically if i am super mega shy to ask a girl out while being 28 and super in need of one ur basically saying go in front of 200 people who may do whatever when u dont agree with them 100% its not even not agreeing it is just being even nouanced lying would be super easy but somehow i just Dont want to since then im even worse off its not even that just saying something and the definition being different then i am taken out of context and possibly judged for something i have not even said or thought people Dont seem to care to check or re-ask. They just go with whatever stereotype they seem to get and without ADHD meds i seem not very holy eventho i am super mega moral.
[01.11.2023, 08:55:35] Marco Luca Hefti: Ja. So basically people fuck with me and Dont let me leave, ammend, lern, explain, communicate, do not even say so, have to guess. Well its just a contingency
[01.11.2023, 08:58:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Who knows. At least a interessting "life" although i have not really lived much so far i dont call life with the ADHD cloud/supressed whatever life it is but some kinda idk... Really hard to do stuff even go to church, friends, work, or anything including good deeds or just anything movie, work, timeeffitientcy, normal dayily things everything, sleep but still overall ok i am grateful for that.
[01.11.2023, 08:58:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Eventho seems like needless blocking and suffering at least if it was some kinda lerning experience
[01.11.2023, 10:24:33] Marco Luca Hefti: Pina sounds like pizza the usual maybe its a form of it idk...
[01.11.2023, 10:35:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Victors texts i have to handle with care so ill do the big tasks when i do some smaller ones so not everything pilles up and i forget smth
[01.11.2023, 10:49:01] Marco Luca Hefti: I can never get things done always family or something else it is impossible especially with beign slow and ADHD
[01.11.2023, 11:11:43] Marco Luca Hefti: A manipulative person may use religion to there Advantages does not mean they have to be religous themselfes. Some people are exptionall at appearances. (im not manipulative by the way ill  strive for win-win) so ja just saying depending on contingency.... anyway i gotta probably be in the city so reading now lets me go right after meeting dad for talk about work probably or why he wanted to meet.
[01.11.2023, 13:44:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Vater troffe. Genau wieder ind ere phase wo d Meds ufhöre hei gfahre. Ha irgendwie s gfühl wird Manipuliert aber hey nid als würd d Schwiz sich drum kümmere. Am End han i irgendöpis zämme gredet
[01.11.2023, 14:20:36] Marco Luca Hefti: I said “Wenn d Lüt eim so dri lege ohni das öper z schade cho isch denn sötte ne ohni Rücksicht näh knallhart mit em Alterslimit ufe” oder das das nid richtig sig und echti Fäll schmällere würd will d Lüt denn angst hätte anhand vo dem mit wennig schuld usser jeh nach politischer Istellig unter s Reder z ko. Ich stimm dem nid zue. Immer durch zuefall trifft min Vater und frogt oder Sache wärde agsproche genau während dere Zit wo s med kurzfristig Sinkt und me sich verspricht. Man bi echt unglücklich. Naja. Zum Glück stimm i nid anhand vo Impulsiv güssertem oder so ab naja zumindest dänk i das Lüt das bevorzuge würde ‎<This message was edited>

[01.11.2023, 15:32:18] Marco Luca Hefti: Random hypothesis: maybe paychopaths have cognitive inflexebility in some neural networks/brainregions maybe a imbalance when it comes to understanding other people maybe mirroring processes suncontiously or by subtlety and tone of voice and mimik directed then they struggle to find common ground but on the other hand have impressive abilitys because of higher cognitive capacity by having repurposed those brain regions. Given some people might have also been blessed with something or some purpose as to fullfill a higer purpose u might say as in doing something for some interspecies benefit or being of possessing valuable genetic information if environmentally lerned or experienced or by matter of transporting some genetic info from a further corner of the world i hypothesis if that is true that foreners might have some kind if advantague in some cases however it might be offset by more short ranging evolutionary arms races where they might somethimes outweigh overall value from a genetic point of view this is not to be confused with human value or value in the common usage of the term but merely a metric by which i quantify % such considerations where most would be a combination of hundreds of tousands, millions and more factors with some weighting more than others.
[01.11.2023, 15:39:23] Marco Luca Hefti: In that way someone testing me would be a psychopaths or super geniuses way to attempt the sporadic testing that might be occuring in normal friendships but maybe on a less scalable level.

Aka u are friends and extend the benefit of the doubt even in the absence of conteols however ur body keeps track of some metrics and by some way gauges ur adherence so u cant just betray ur friends forever they d figure it out.

To be fair it might also be a naive bias of mine to jump to win-win aka want to see the “good/social in people” and accept them even when not standard. 

Kinda like dealing with a impulsive dangerous strong big dog. However the analogy breaks down but the point is to handle something above or barely within ur capability’s.

It is however likely a false hope.

Also i think it is not neatly covering a bunch of things but it could be a slightly interesting thing.

Anyway…
[01.11.2023, 15:53:08] Marco Luca Hefti: Honestly 1 thing.  No woman i ever dated can say i did not care about her since i remember and risked great travesty of course it depends on which basyan probability and maybe none apply and maybe that empathy i had in combination with great ability and great luck of the adhd treatment seems to now be left without the nessesary capability well of course it is true that if i can so less the people who wanted or want something will also have to be fine with less and puting stones to punish will not increase but just decrease that likelyhood even more. Anyway i think i just wrote some dreams and they are now misused in some playing with me in a uncool way so ill wont take them too seriously but it feels quite consistant if that is true im a really good person. Another proof being actually good seems to not matter why matters is to know what the powerful want and then do that. Seems not very moral but maybe it is how the world works. Maybe the more adhd and slower the brain the harder it is to conceil such things who knows.
[01.11.2023, 16:00:54] Marco Luca Hefti: totally forgot Zivildienst is not just military without guns but can also be work
[01.11.2023, 16:29:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Since the initial boost i seem to get gradually tored out and weeker. I guess the meds where never right but the atuff somehow timed so it does quickly lift me and then i come down no matter what i do of course this is not a claim it is a guess based on some spesific contingencys/basyan prob. possibilities
[01.11.2023, 16:42:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Volunteered or called and email quickly somehow less exhausting or easy idk why
[01.11.2023, 16:50:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad asked what i want for birthday. Not sure what to say i said life back aka ADHD meds treatment but did not want to harp about it so just said it kinda "idk nothing" way. Then he said i should think and send him WhatsApp
[01.11.2023, 17:00:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Ich antworte darauf ein bisschen länger um ein bisschen Übersicht zu verschaffen und damit wir garantiert vom gleichen sprechen🙂

Mit aktiv suchen meine ich, dass du nun zu einem neuen Psychiater gehen möchtest sobald dieser Zeit hat und du dann auch regelmässige Termine mit ihm beabsichtigst. Mir war nicht klar, dass du das nun willst (mehr dazu weiter unten).

Ob du einen solchen Psychiater selber suchst oder jemand anderes diesen für dich sucht spielt für mich keine Rolle, beides verstehe ich als "aktiv suchen", sofern es nicht ein "Suchen auf unbestimmt" ohne Terminvereinbarung ist.

Dein primärer bzw. leitender Psychiater (standard Psychiater wie du es nennst) momentan ist ja noch immer Herr Dubach, sekundär in Zusammenarbeit für die ADHS-Medikamente Frau Dr. Rohmeder-Arday.

Dass du seit Jahren zu einem neuen Psychiater willst ist mir definitiv neu. Öfters hast du mir gegebüber in vergangenen Jahren zwar vieles angedeutet, auf Nachfrage dann jedoch stets gesagt, dass du gerne zu Herrn Dubach gehst und zufrieden bist mit Medikamente über Frau Rohmeder-Arday (und ehemals Herrn Dold) zu beziehen und dich melden würdest, falls du stattdessen zu einem anderen Psychiater gehen willst.

Es war einmal das Verlangen und die Bereitschaft da, zusätzlich in Sprechstunden für kognitive Verhaltenstherapie bei einem Psychologen zu gehen, was dann jedoch aus diversen Gründen nie zustande kam. 

Nachdem ich am 13.09.2023 Rücksprache hielt mit Michael Schneider, Oberarzt der ADHS-Sprechstunde in der UPK Akutambulanz, hattest du eine Sprechstunde mit ihm woraufhin man dich für ein Vorgespräch im ZPP angemeldet hatte. Als ich am 20.10.23 mit den UPK telefonierte hiess es, du hättest das Erstespräch mit Frau Rebecca Bendel gehabt, für das weitere Vorgehen würde man jedoch seither versuchen Herrn Dubach zu kontaktieren. Seither hatte ich bezogen auf dich ausser mit Frau Rohmeder-Arday betr. deinen Rezepten keinen Kontakt zu den UPK.

Das erste mal bewusst wahrgenommen, dass es ein ernstes Anliegen von dir ist zu einem anderen Psychiater zu gehen als Herrn Dubach und / oder Frau Rohmeder-Arday, habe ich in einer Nachricht von dir am 28.09.23 als du erwähnt hast, einmal eine "Psychiater Strategie" zu versuchen. Im Folgetermin am Tag darauf (29.09.23) in welchem ich dies ansprach und, wie du korrekt vernommen hast, meine Hilfe angeboten habe, meintest du, es sei für den Moment so wie es ist mit Hern Dubach und Frau Rohmeder-Arday doch gut, aber du behälst es im Hinterkopf und schaust dich einmal um. Du würdest bei Bedarf auf mich zukommen, wenn ich dir bei der Suche nach einem neuen Psychiater helfen sollte. 

Momentan würdest du deine Medikamente nicht ändern wollen, da du eine gewisse Stabilität mit kleinen, aber dafür stetigen Forwärtsschritten verspüren würdest und nicht riskieren willst, dich in dieser Zeit aufgrund von allfälligen Anpassungsschwankungen nicht mehr bewerben zu können, was du momentan jedoch machen würdest. Deshalb sei ein neuer Psychiater deiner Meinung nach nicht dringend momentan und bei Bedarf meiner Hilfe diesbezüglich, würdest du wie gesagt auf mich zukommen.

Ich bot dir an einen Bericht zur Übernahme für einen neuen Psychiater zu verfassen falls du zu einem neuen gehen würdest, sofern du unsere Sprechstunden auf unbestimmt pausieren / beenden willst. Dazu sagte ich jedoch, dass du dich dann noch immer jederzeit wieder bei mir melden darfst wenn du erneut Sprechstunden willst, egal ob sporadisch oder regelmässig. Weiterhin bot ich dir bei Bedarf an einen Zwischen-Bericht zu verfassen, falls du zu einem neuen Psychiater gehst und trotzdem weiterhin Sprechstunden mit mir haben willst, sodass dieser über den groben thematischen Ablauf unserer Sprechstunden im Bilde ist.

Dies hat jedoch nichts mit einem neuen Hausarzt für dich zu tun.
Zwar könnte man eine Laborabklärung auch über einen Psychiater veranlassen, aber es gibt mehr Sinn, dies über den Hausarzt zu tun. Dies unter anderem, da gewisse Routine-Kontrollen welche bei ADHS sinnvoll sind 1. viele Hausarztpraxen z. T. direkt selber messen können und 2. auch für die allgemeine Gesundheit unabhängig von ADHS nützlich sein können. 3. dein Hausarzt eigentlich die Anlaufstelle sein sollte, welcher den langfristigen Überblick über deine physiologischen Werte behält.
[01.11.2023, 17:01:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Ich wollte das schon lange, aber dann hab ich oft die Erinnerung daran (evt bei Medikationsänderungen oder Ablenkung) verloren oder keinen Antrieb und habe es den Leuten um mich herum gesagt wie Famile, Freunde und Herrn Dubach, dir und Rohmeder. Und ja ich hab auch lange diese Strategie versucht das stimmt. 

Diese war eine mögliche Antwort im draft aber context complex nur als contingency

[01.11.2023, 17:53:17] Marco Luca Hefti: I can also remember having narcisisstic phase when i was small and i can also remember getting out of it that is different from when i was brilliant it might be that i was having trouble with narcissistic tendencys but then i solved some philisophical quandarys and/or got the balance and then i was amazing and then i was back to being ADHD and everything sucked and then i was having some phases where i was angry and narcissist like but more tortrured i dont think i am but i see the paralells but i think i would clearly defend and argue conclusively for not being one. But who knows maybe i am not aware eventho im being told how selfaware and introspective and humble i am a lot (some say i am not but that is rare and usually seem to fold or not even try to make a case or move the goalpoast then abandon and change topic i think when two people with high confidence meet one with the lower one might also lose brain ability? even if they are correctly humble and the other one is not maybe it is about who has more of that confidence true or not hm.
[01.11.2023, 17:53:17] Marco Luca Hefti: I think when ur NRI is too much and ur dopa cant keep up ur stuck in some narcisstic thing hm..... maybe the people cant get out themselfes hm...... its kinda like the closer you are to something the better it works but when ur too close u get dragged down the other side it seems to be a issue of balance. Coming back to the cerebellum. Hm....... It seems implicated in ADHD.... hmmmmmmmmmm i think im getting to something with ADHD here......... but honestly only becasue i can remember some things. This is nothing but it could be a hypothesis in the future if i choose and am allowed to get into it.
[01.11.2023, 17:53:18] Marco Luca Hefti: I think i can remember meeting someone that was a narcissist and i was humble just for a second and i could almost feel like im losing my ability /executive function and i realized that eventho i might have been right it now does not matter and that is why people might refuse or have such a hard time to admit to things or see  that they are maybe mistaken. It is not that they dont want to be they kinda have to be. It is what i always suspected.
[01.11.2023, 17:53:18] Marco Luca Hefti: Otherwise the thikheadedness would make no sense/would have made little sense i think there is somethng it might not be that and i dont claim absolute certaintly but i think there might be smth there.
[01.11.2023, 18:21:28] Marco Luca Hefti: My parents are kinda beautiful in that they warm my heart and some of the other people also warm my heart eventho they somethimes  seem ..... like im not sure but if they do bad things they eather do not know or they absolutly feel nothing like totally psychopathic or they are smarter than they seem (which i always suspected and i still suspect but ja i never write of anyone i just get bored and lose hope in finding it and then the person seems to not talk hm..........)

So if narcissistic then some deep intuition seems very fooled

[01.11.2023, 18:23:19] Marco Luca Hefti: So this leads me to have a tiny bit more confidence. If people just had enoght love and u would not have to worrie then it would be much easier i guess i lack massive amounts of confidence to be social
[01.11.2023, 18:23:33] Marco Luca Hefti: hm to be fair it is not for lack of trying.
[01.11.2023, 18:23:47] Marco Luca Hefti: and ja its not like i cant ADHD meds show..... hm......
[01.11.2023, 18:23:57] Marco Luca Hefti: (depending on dosage and med)

[01.11.2023, 18:24:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Allright tmr church wanned to go today but i forgot meds so i had to rush back home and then i forgot somehow.......
[01.11.2023, 18:27:32] Marco Luca Hefti: The beautiful thing about churches is it is kinda community and the human connection that may be called god or spirit would be a beautiful reason to meet. But usually people seem to think i am crazy when i say that or ask if it has to be a man and cant be more i think symbolism and concepts and metaphor and parables seem quite prevalent i love those naturally but also that seems to have been.... not really accepted so far when i would.... now im intrigued 🤔 

Man not making quick judgements is SUCH a good thing there almost always is more to things. To be fair it needs to be balanced.

So easy it can go and u sleep almost 30 min later than planed
[03.11.2023, 05:48:29] Marco Luca Hefti: I would visit the hon that is paralized but i dont know where she is or if it was just a dream. Somehow i forgot if real maybe because meds taken away or maybe something else a person did. Or because i felt no warmth and was a child and also forgot the adress maybe and parents would not say? Idk
[03.11.2023, 07:04:16] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe on the playground a girl drove down the stairs with a play car. Could this be the paralized girl maybe she injured herself maybe that is the girl in the bed. But i forgot about it probably because of adhd or because someone did something to my memory. But seems more like dreams. Can a hypnotist induce memorys? Or can you dream dreams that expand on each other? 7:02 3.11.23

Both hypnotists and dreams can play a role in the retrieval or generation of memories and experiences:

1. **Hypnotists**: Hypnosis can be used to attempt to retrieve suppressed or forgotten memories. However, it's essential to note that the accuracy of these memories can sometimes be questionable. Hypnotically retrieved memories can be a mix of real memories, interpretations, and fabrications. Therefore, any memory recalled under hypnosis should be approached with caution and not taken as absolute truth.

2. **Dreams**: Dreams can sometimes be a way our subconscious processes past events, fears, desires, or scenarios that our conscious mind has thought about or imagined. It is possible for dreams to have recurring themes or continue a "story" over multiple nights. However, dreams are also highly symbolic and often not literal representations of reality.

It's always essential to approach any memory or dream content with an open mind and, if needed, consult with professionals in psychology or dream analysis to get a better understanding of its significance or authenticity.

[06.11.2023, 16:09:40] Marco Luca Hefti: Going to church ⛪️ expanding horizon, following a flyer later than planed but better late then never
[06.11.2023, 18:31:51] Marco Luca Hefti: Quite intense « Handauflegung » (Lay on Hands) experience a bit like meditation, unusually deep focus and/or prayer also with a « connection/spiritual » feeling and a connection to the devine/community throught the person. I was right in the middle of the lay on hands stations and prayed long while i waited. ⛪️ 

I was not nurished, cold, waited long, discomfort but during the « healing/ (forgot the other two things that where said and the prayr spoken over me) *, * » I felt like my shoulders lowered and i breathed veeery deep and at ease. It was a good experience it just takes some time.

I was invited to do it again and recogniced to have come although the person and myself where not sure maybe they somehow knew when i was there some time ago and layed down lights/candles and so on when it was empty.
[06.11.2023, 18:35:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Very nice people. I told some things about life and they felt sorry but i did not mean it that way but that was just a small thing due to my quite inhibited smoothness and reduced connection to my “emotional heart” so to say i guess executive functions aka adhd id say

[07.11.2023, 16:29:28] Marco Luca Hefti: I cant remember being a dumb prick (or too little leasure to care about anyone elses much when people where ignorant to seemingly simple solutions on top of that) anymore but i could habe been. Idk. When u have no chance it is no shame to concede immediately and stockholmeffect urself a non shitty life.

But who knows if i touched a 2y old while  i was 2-5y and cant remember while adhd and without meds and that is why my life is deatroyed then honestly people would be justifyed to touch rape and break all kind of laws in revenge however since im so classy and woul rather find a win/win solution and since i have the gun to my head all evil is fine effect i would not do that even if free for long but honestly that seems super stupid (the exessivw punish) and the bipolar dude i offered frendship he offered no reason opression then everyone was hitting and evryone there was basically brutal and litterally att me for no reason so. Also noone told me of that and i immediately regret and knew reason it w wrong but my thing was way less than joking me uncontious way higher lasting damage probabiluty i guess also group keept me from small get back no choice while i do not inhibit anyone from small getback and are open for explanations why stuff bad. I even proactively seek them out.

Also i have philantropic mindset.

Also i would say i am kinda better as aly than foe. And i would also concider the rights and experiences of psychopaths and other minoritys. At least i was open to reason others where not. Not goimg to be a pon that is not equally benefitial than my potential and very much resistant to do bad things as a pon while bad seems often subjectve

Anxiety quite common, feeling of discomfort at muskespannung when holding anything upright even Arms or Fingers from time to time but also more endurance to hold it out a bit. Overall discomfort but relative ok/average for recent weeks. Maybe also lower food intake since a bit low motivation to make food. And keep forgetting regular food despite timers a bit so ja also cant remember what i ate since remembering causes discomoft so i usually Dont try to remember because of the discomoft associated with it i guess. Also discomoft inhibits breathing a bit its all a bit nothing strong id lay mild to moderate and quite stable  over the recent months. Maybe since i started doing things and went from 20 Eqauasim to 30mg Equasim and the boost phase possibly

I am grateful for the few silimted relations i had limited both friend/ladys as is common for some adhd people however it does seem not to match with the level of creativity and my “karma” so far but grateful still.

Also grateful for a interessting life noone can say this “adhd un/barely treated” joruney was boring (well it was a lot but it seems to improve my abilitys and wisdom also seems to improve “correlationaly/in tandem” (or however it is called).

[10.11.2023, 10:42:50] Marco Luca Hefti: -One part of ADHD seems to be the variability in remembering therefor you cant plan since ur  task might go 5 min or 2 or 6 hours depending on distractions and so on therefore u only have a priorisation and a very rought timeplan. Maybe the discomfort at being slow and then saving ur speed and then when needed speeding up is not so possible since it might be more of a less dynamic thing or more consistant variable a bit like Noradrenalin being fixed with small changes rather than a up and down may be a chronic over or underactivation of stress systems or something who knows.

[10.11.2023, 14:52:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Called him to ask if i have to apply when i have a job Zusage he said "it is better" "I would" so yes but not a clear yes so to be save i force myself to continue i think its saver anyway. Also he said about 1 Bewerbung a week not how many in total so my Familys advice was wrong it is by week and does not matter how much which seems counterintuitve Since you would think it is about how much you send not when you send it but i got it now Ah so i should have sent or added the application i made to personalvermittler
[10.11.2023, 14:53:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Also spoke about some other stuff. Seemed not as "ja all great" as before

Guten Tag Herr Hefti

 

Gerne bestätige ich den Erhalt. Ich leite dies gerne weiter.

 

Ich wünsche Ihnen ein schönes Wochenende.


Freundliche Grüsse

Ilir Salihi"

he said eventho i already uploaded weeks ago it probably was already going to Personalberater and that was why it was not uploaded anymore and that it would be easyer to quickly forward him all so he can just "bestätigunsmail" to me because he did not know where they went (to what Personalberater) I said sure i will do that if it is easyer and i did that is why email was writen that way. First one i wrote but seemingly forgot because ADHD and medication difficultrys i would guess working memory/executive functions.
[10.11.2023, 15:13:50] Marco Luca Hefti: I asked dad if i should handle the things spoken about with Frau Rohmeder he said he handles everything i should not if he is determined u better not say no. And its fine with me.
[10.11.2023, 15:19:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Big noise outside all day no idea what they are doing.

[10.11.2023, 15:21:13] Marco Luca Hefti: they only call when i am in a call and then half the time the website does not work and the other now it says they cant call you its just so unlucky like coincidences city like ive never seen them

[10.11.2023, 15:29:31] Marco Luca Hefti: just ringed til it stopped eventually
[10.11.2023, 15:56:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Rechtsauskunft Anruf Monday since eventho they are open the phoneline dont work at all. So i cant call in case police wants me to call or there is some law that u have to call and they might tell people to give false advice to test something. Its a "even if illogical just do it" depends on contingency
[10.11.2023, 15:56:56] Marco Luca Hefti: allright no Rechtsauskunft for days and ja
[10.11.2023, 16:25:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Frau Ursprung Wachtmeister vom Polizei Klaraposten (minimal ungewöhnlicher Name dacht ich mir) Meinte Töff/Motorrad kann nicht wie von person TCS behauptet mit Nummernschild/Registrierung und aktiver Versicherung nur transportiert werden (auch von privaten Firmen) sondern solange privater Grund dann kein selbst-fahren sondern nur aufgeladen gefahren auf privatem Grund wieder abgeladen werden, eigentlich logisch aber man kann darauf scheinbar nicht gehen jeh nach Erfahrung. Aber ja Leute machen Fehler oder versprechen sich oder hören nicht richtig zu nichts neues. Eventuell abgelenkt ka wieso. Super. 

Dankbar dafür wenn das stimmt. :]

[11.11.2023, 07:06:54] Marco Luca Hefti: Prayed. 
In Name of 1-2-3:
Apologized for thibgs that i should apologize and are true and respect [] to not apologize for the wrong things (honestly.. whatever materializes dream life and anything respectful and praising on topi did also)
Asked for impeadibt influences or things to not hold me back when i should do it the way without meds change / both / or with meds dont care if outcomes spiritually and ladys/goals/performance/givibg back after work. I dont just want to be rich have a ladys because rich and give money but enjoy getting there and akibt friends and experiences along the way, that seems almost the most important thing but i guess happyness can be irrespective of outside it is said but my motives are not only selfish or jot only for pleasure so it might be hard/impossible to just be normal and be happy since it seems not my dna or whatever i humbly admit im not allknowing as seemingly all humans are said to be but i dont know.
And gratefulness for sleep and morninng and this drive to do that, find this audiobook, and most of all the memories and ja for what is good.. and hope i guess…
Amen after.
[11.11.2023, 07:09:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Today RAV, then timemanagement, audiobook, some other things on todo oist since i am temporarily so insanely under my speed potential that it seems like the list barely gets worked through and time goes on but ill be faithful that doing common things improves it.

[11.11.2023, 08:07:03] Marco Luca Hefti: A moral narcissist could function like a keeper and optimizer win-win of peoples desires and goals therefore again a place in the world for people with seemingly little acceptance commonly depending on context as so many others?
[11.11.2023, 08:07:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Or a combo of people a team

[11.11.2023, 17:30:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Very slow progress RAV thing
[11.11.2023, 19:34:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Here are some general ideas i would like to do since im small irrespective of religosity or not it is not exhaustive but might give a idea of what i like:
"""Generally i wanted to make machine lerning /STATISTICALLY increasingly automated / halvautomated programms usw that use macros and or code and metric tracking to get me layed more, happyer, more performant and friends and get me more time and more done in less time and more enjoyment doing those things. And being rich doing AI stuff and having better relationships and even more fun and exploration discovery and using my brain and my brian collaboratively/collectively and discover and solve challenges and opportunitys etc.

So lots of sex or lots of increasing better use of my time as fast as possible while living happy/healthy as long as i can and to be fair eather be immortal or when it is 100% super mega ultra proven that there is a heaven that is less important but its good to just assume it is not or better even if it is you still strive for things on this earth right? Also figure out how to behave and decide things int he best way to best get all those things as well. My assets are ideas, problemsolving, ambition, flexibility, chill, non boring, treu, faithful (meaning i would treat you how i would want to be treated and make great efforts to understand and adapt the happyer i am and the less i feel wronged the more it would do so. Also strong win-win and social mindset, and childlike curiosity and no ego eventho i have all the emotional flaws i can massively inhibit them depending on what, so patience, and I enjoy intellectual things and all kinds of experiences from being in a dirty place making out or watching smth funny caring about only the moment and not being mature to super mature and highly cordial and highly selfless and thinking longterm.

Weekness are executive functions and being selfreliant. The positive side of that is i wont just go off alone. Also knowing what people want or understanding them might be a bit hard."""

Forgiveness, Praise and for good/dreams/visionary manifestation of dreams or even to start or if not possible just the mental health/spirit to do it without waiting until im super old since “the journey is the goal” so to say hoping to be njoy that pursuit and be very timefritient and productive because happy/motivated/energetic, also guidance in what to explore and discover that might improve those goals.

Just general the best and hopes while they grow and adapt with me over my life like so far (eventho they where quite stable for a while to the core pilars it seems)

[14.11.2023, 06:24:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Jucy tight breasts of a gf with exessive libido intellect and my morals with chain and cross are the stereotype of the hot spiritual young my age hottie. Trained be super nice and super “i did not expect u are exactly as into s as me but more or only fun if brilliance smoothness and a fundamental great work/social and allround life are in place ladys should not be the only thing
[14.11.2023, 06:55:38] Marco Luca Hefti: “Saint Matthew, patron of financial prudence, and Saint Andrew, connector of faith and people, I seek your intercession. Guide me in making wise decisions that align with my aspirations and responsibilities. May the wisdom of the Holy Spirit enlighten my path, granting me clarity and insight. I pray for the courage to act upon these choices with integrity and the vision to see the opportunities that lay before me. Amen”

Some prayr example honoring tradition and such hope it works when it comes to executive functions and such

[14.11.2023, 10:33:25] Marco Luca Hefti: No reiner to be seen. He said he is here all day usually yeaterday as well.

Maybe he is stikl eating or slow to make it here. Ran to make it symbolicly eventho makes no difference in actuallity from a typical pro/contra for Reiner
[14.11.2023, 10:33:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Rein*

[14.11.2023, 18:16:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Respected churches prayed sang so
[14.11.2023, 18:19:01] Marco Luca Hefti: Sucked a lot but also good at some points by comparison helps appreciate abit. Feeling a bit “ohmächtig” at system that appears disfunctional at times but cant make judgement and wont help. Only positive motivation and energy helps

[15.11.2023, 18:24:24] Marco Luca Hefti: So ja i could be faster I guess i would be able to do more for Rein Holdo (Obdachlos) but im also a bit exhausted from 0 freetime and not being layed so long and being kinda insanely adhd and lots more. So ja just gona do what i can being slow and wait until some standard ADHD treatment or some angel or god reacts to any prayr or smth maybe luck or some epiphany not like i Dont endlessly do stuff im not sitting around doing nothing in fact i have to make sure to do something else or then it is i do too much and Dont just "relax and mindlessly do stuff" i even do that. So ja. Discomofor? Out of my comfort zone for years? Sure all done in various forms
[15.11.2023, 18:25:05] Marco Luca Hefti: My comfort zone is often the discomfort zone lol so LOTS of uppward potential (which often happens and i will eventually gravitate back to my true self) hopefully.
[15.11.2023, 18:30:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Did some prayrs maria church and many other churches cant write all little time. Maybe i am slightly slow currently but kinda normal when testing or being on some meds and when restartng things. Better off since a few months.
[15.11.2023, 19:02:54] Marco Luca Hefti: called for suler gapelstapler but im exhausted to do stuff before i did not secure my basic RAV stuff and i keep forgetting i really want to do those things (eather it is a good dead or some symbolic or other people would concider it prove of moral stuff where i would say nope it is less moral than stuff i did over my life it is more intense sure and maybe more uncomfortable yes. But building a hourse without hammer nails and constuction equipment is also way more uncomfortable probably but does not mean you did actally more good int he world you probably build less houses as a analogy. However i do appreachate the deep close perspective for sure. I love that opportunity but i would have done so anyway. But the coincidence to see them or whatever lead to it i appreachate that. (of course i mean like having the motivation and drive and energy and lust and many other seeming coinicdences in those days or paths crossed so to say.

I also apprachate that peole understand the emotional and close range angle vs the overall philantropic big impact stuff. Of course if people think im a immoral pedp and therefor took all my below 30 sex away and no ADHD treatment sabotage i would feel differently than if lets say some super wise thing where i wont lose out but get some very hard lesson which i would hate but would respect especially if it is not a mistake or unnessesary but even if i could see that. Or a resonable punishment even if extreamly exessive (not saying i am a pedo in fact i am not u can litterally make me a kindergarden dude (that sounds kinda sweet however children are somethimes kinda less cute when u actually have to deal with them without my brilliance/smoothness/brain especially when im exhausted/tired/and kinda slow to remember and feeling negative i Dont think it would be the best time to have the most fun since it can be super fun i imagine having cute horde running around. Sounds also kinda romantic to have a hot kinergarden personal in your age maybe ur girlfriend anyway. But those are the finer plesures of life so fine in fact that it is hard to enjoy them too much i am more kinda a intense person. So i think that alone would not make me happy if i was not on the best best performance or this kinda "dopamine/stimulant feel or noradrenalin idk..... just when i feel very motivated and quick" then it could totally be super fun.

Anyway u digressed. I just saw a lot of kindergarden classes travling around basel to my obdachlose people and churches i also saw some cute my age people i kinda like earpiercings since you would hope those people would be more confident or higher "kiss-drive" but.... not sure that is the case no experience there yet which i would love to. Or maybe i think they are less desirable and therefore i have a chance or smth eventho i think i am very desirable and all but guess i lack confidence to be fair im not at my usuall game / so maybe it is partially normal to feel this exessive non normal longterm termporary not at all myself exessive unrealistic lack of "feel more confidence and comfortable and ask someone out" Maybe it is because basel has so many people coming becuase pharma and border maybe so it might be normal however everyone i know is filled with Ladys/relationships like its nothing so but those might just be my environment so ja coincidences. Anyway not like i ask only within family but not even there since halv-brothers/brothers seem not overly keen to share
[15.11.2023, 20:28:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Going to bed way later than intendet
[16.11.2023, 07:24:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Pretty much had forgotten the trash and machine thank god i saw hot l put o trash
[16.11.2023, 07:47:33] Marco Luca Hefti: I lose the drive to make protocolls i noticed.

Its like i dont know what to do in a prioriticed manner and even if i forget and im slow since the outcomes dont seem to near its like “give up” feel.

So lots of stuff not written and probably more to come. Putting down trash

I also dont write every good thing i do i think i am not selfish enought or looking out for myself its like i dont careb but i do lots. I also dont really hide bad stuff i think i gotte become more superficiall since others seem to do that and bot look through it so ja but since that sucks i might just do less or out more importance elsewhwre ither than protocolls in whatsapp
[16.11.2023, 07:47:54] Marco Luca Hefti: Put trash down & geschirr maschine empty
[16.11.2023, 07:55:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Depending on contingency i could see why people are not nicer and so much crime and immoral stuff. Depending on contingency it does not matter or it does anyway. "Doing ur dreams/best anyway" seems like good motto
[16.11.2023, 08:01:37] Marco Luca Hefti: I may have to think more stupid since investing money might be a low priority task but lets just make a crazy hypothesis just as a example: "God does not allow the best way or kinda u do the investing eventho its less important and then you get lifted up later then its like tecnically the rules have been broken but tecnically you whre better off." Its like u run a race and some dude says just drink tea with me then you say im sure i should run then you do it and in the end they just declare u the winner or shortcut cheat u in front off everyone. The problem with that is it defies all logic and you kinda have to know also could just be a test if u break the rules or follow so ja. Kinda selects for strange people it would seem. Anyway No idea why this random ADHD thought now priorisation and time management both obdachlose and RAV bewerbungsstuff and sport

Lieber hott bitte vergib (mir) uns unsere Sünden und führe uns nicht in Versuchung sondern erlôse mich von dem bôsen den dein ist das Reich und die Kraft und die Herrlichkeit in Ewigkeit. 
Amen 🙏 

Lieber Gott

Bitte vergieb meine sünden und das ich von deutsch auf english wechsle ich war viel unterwegs um hoffentlich Dinge zu tun die in deinem Sinne sind.
Vielen Dank für all die guten Dinge und so viel schönes oder intensives auch wenn oft hart evt mehr als andere Leute aber imernoch super und ich habe unglaubliche höhen in Arbeit, Wissen, Performance, E.F., Schlagfertigkeit, charisma, beilianc, ehrenhaftigkeit, trauer, top organisation, top Zeitmanagement, Ein Gefühl als könnte ich alles tun.
Nun eine Bitte:
Bitte schau auf die overwelming positive things boone seems to recognize since i did not think k some human would just go by what they feel but actually everything i see, feel, do and my intensions and even things i dont notice would go into it.
Please guide me to do the right thibgs, and please finnaly help me get friends and some Lady maybe that is my libido roughtly i promise to treat her right or every lady since i think i got to just be normal and make out until i find one that matcges me best since sex/cuddle/skincontact is super important to me, otherwise i am really open to all kinda of things and i like all kinda of honorable things and not just things people might misrepresent or attruibute to me. Auch habe ich nie etwas gegen Religion an sich oder reapektlosigkeit vor dem warhaftigen nur vermeintlichen Versionen jeh nach contingency in schmerz selbst dann nie gegen Gott mehr die Ungerechtigkeit oder outdated evolutionary algorythms but then it would more be that defintion and not the “actual God” in the other sense so it would be doubt or not being sure since little signs and aigns against seemingly.
Despite i think im a super good person however i think i am would be less careful and also more selfish if i was sure it had [0 upside to so good things for me or that it was a give and take between humans or else] so ja. Not sure if i am just selfish but am super win-win andempathic non selfish because i think its beat for my large goals& save or i somehow dont feel bad when not doing things for me as well.
I dont know.
If im not allowed adhd meds because i am some super smart dude and everything is as it seems otherwise then it was a big mistake i wouod have been able to do lits od good and anything bad would be for lack of understandinf or fear of me. But dont think so but it is a super tiny hypothesis.

Its insanely brutal since i had no gf until 30 and all the pain/discomfort anyway.

Amen. 

Trying whatsap prayers. No i am not fanatic if u think this is crazy in case smth sees in pedo investig hypothesis then it would do no harm no? just cost some time.

[20.11.2023, 21:41:50] Marco Luca Hefti: Wanna focus some
More Adam eventho he did not write but i did but could do more but seems also to be way healthyer but he said “G. may have sent u” so to honor God just in case it is wanted i would use the organisation i started to improve although lots that could be done to maybe keep my eyes and heart open for a opportunity maybe if i read the notes again
[20.11.2023, 23:13:18] Marco Luca Hefti: Still hungry but ill not eat more i will be fine and in the morning i feel little hunger and will eat because it is said to be best. Victor also said so. And many people say so. Not sure if i should fast but i have not had the confidence or clear sign however it could go both ways fasting and eating regularily.  I could ask some LLM or i would doit as part of some camp mayb church or maybe some friends show me then ill do it for sure. Or if i get a message or conficene i will.
[21.11.2023, 02:06:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe i ahould have ate a bit more. Maybe the gratitude maybe the meds and teeine.

Maybe a sign to not coffee. Hm maybe a good sign for how the recent weeks and month went?.

Hm
[21.11.2023, 09:07:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Took cold shower no coffeine, no multi (often did not take anyway) and no s.

so far 7 min passt did not do much or toruble starting but time resonably slow
[21.11.2023, 09:08:05] Marco Luca Hefti: for 7 min
[21.11.2023, 09:18:57] Marco Luca Hefti: wrote  Rein (not writing all things too many)
[21.11.2023, 09:28:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Miriam Mattäuskirche not mcuh sense since rein already talked and today seems the only day for Bewerbung and maybe motorcycle and some olrganisation and some idk.. overview and then Wednesday mom thursday st Clara Friday smth biblestudy so Dont think it makes sense to go since i could also go Wegkreuz but many things to do gotta prioritize and if i do those two things i have more time when it matters like in 1-2 days when Rein may need more sleeping palce and right now Herr Maurar and people are on the case he told me people go and visit Rein also would probably be fine and can always go Notaufnahme in case / has phone still and Notschlafstelle block might be lifted also possible

now that it might need to be done since i noticed i have been late/close/rushed for a bunch of things

[21.11.2023, 17:17:23] Marco Luca Hefti: Original sin. In some way u can say everything cN lead to some non fitting thing aka low intelligence could be harmful, no empathy, too much anything in a way no diversity and so on.

Hm so born depending on dna could almost be a similar thing to original sin in a lets say “spesific narrow hypothetical”. Anyway..

[21.11.2023, 18:24:15] Marco Luca Hefti: No Rein there
[22.11.2023, 09:02:24] Marco Luca Hefti: Prayed morning. (Guidance, Dream life, Connection, and the usual aka what i deeply would like which could be many small things in balance instead of just words))

1 multivit gum (4 is daily Nahrungsergänzungslimit)

Today lot to doz

[22.11.2023, 10:05:06] Marco Luca Hefti: I walk back
[22.11.2023, 10:06:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Co2 footprint of travling ÖV is near 0 a relative to the Tram driving in the first place. And maybe they are quite effitient anyway.
[22.11.2023, 10:06:33] Marco Luca Hefti: So that would be a example of good intentions but wrong focus and it might be counterintuitive

[24.11.2023, 10:50:08] Marco Luca Hefti: Some:

« « Möglichkeiten:

tmr:
-another Bewerbung (before the week ends)
-Motorcycle
-Calling Maurer Heilsarmee for Rein Holdo
-Checking to do List
-ask the lady from the flower store out to Eli Dance thing or the Music thing Rein spoke of or some church event (obviously if she is full age at minimum and not in a relationship to not get smited by law/God)
-Ask Victor if he want to still go and how me how he goes in „Ausgang“ as the time when the lady in Peter Merian university walked when i had gray Hair in front by Coiffeur. And be grateful to Victor/Grateful in general to that opportunity if she was full age since i was too scared i guess.

-go train boxing since some interesting people do it and it shows/symbolizes my unconditional forgiveness (from someone from harlier reto)and focus on win/win/ most fun awesome life and not pointless hate when i could win/win work on the causalitys if i must/should.

-i could also do a lot of things for my old friend, or other people but i think if i become more productive i can help much more or do good things or be content and follow rules/things more diligently (so a girlfriend with my libido/confidence to meet woman on tinder or by going out with friends if allowed and if i should or somehow have more sex and blowjobs with finish and sex how i would like (anal) or lady doing more not just passively lay or just have higher libido and be open for fun things nothing crazy if not good/allowed, i also like to cuddle and change scenery or try many different small changes like position or kiss in creative ways i am extreamly creative just need a hon that plays along and usually if she enjoys it too it might be best for both.
-I could join stadthelfer to help out near mattäuschurch for the homeless food place
-I could go GGG meet instead of Rein Holdo
-I could go to the jazz music of Frau Öri Rein spoke off.
-I could help quadriplegics/gelähmt from the waist down people in case i had something to so with it or if not just because i feel like i could do some good.
-I wNt to help the lady in the bed who seems to be dying for that i need better timemanagement and social ability would be good (foresight) this one is probably like divine/brainpower so maybe hard to get. I could try to do „rescue time“ course i bought or/and buy the books/audiobooks to listen to and see if i can make google calendar and combine things with exist.
-And ask Sascha if he wants to do the machine learning thing.
-i could write with A.I. and see if i get some tipps what to do or read my notes what i forgot.
-If i won lot of money or had a network i could do smth to combine the helpOrganisations in some way to make it easyer for people that are homeless or to find out that it was not a issue i currently prioritise it to symbolically show im not faking and eventho my other things i did where probably going unnoticed (however im not sure of that, maybe just no immediate impact on my life) and i lacked some balance in direct help not just the longterm big things.
-maybe i can do smth in the city not just globally and hard to detect stuff socially/micro i mean the city is big enought so i could make connections that lead to a dream/good sex or/and friends and have interesting experiences.

I kinda wanna advance the world but might be too fast and i kinda have to fix my basics time could be soooo much slower its going by soooooooo much quicker than my potential.

-I am grateful for many things those then lead me to those ideas and i likely forgit many others many maybe way higher priority » »
[24.11.2023, 10:50:08] Marco Luca Hefti: -Find out how to do something nice/interessting to have something else to offer. Hm
[24.11.2023, 10:50:08] Marco Luca Hefti: So shy to make tinder even if i where hot (grateful i am now for body some parts but psychology/character/and the effort to be romantic snd confidence biggest thing always has been exept when i was young and my true character comes through)
[24.11.2023, 10:50:08] Marco Luca Hefti: Put some trash away on church qnd some poop was on it unlucky also no water anywhere near also rushing because 40 Equasim
[24.11.2023, 10:50:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Called because A Suler and J. R. H
[24.11.2023, 10:50:09] Marco Luca Hefti: offered volunteer thigns to 3-4 some sayd they check "bedarf" and contact
[24.11.2023, 10:50:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Herr M called that Herr Hunke / Rein is ag the St J church. Going. Elisabeten Church after then training
[24.11.2023, 10:50:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Mage übel LF food
[24.11.2023, 10:50:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Grateful & Pray.
[24.11.2023, 10:50:09] Marco Luca Hefti: Could have done a lot more but ill did what i could and the gym was still Abit discomfort but i liked to accomplish things. I do freel slightly spiritual but nothing extreme.. Elizabth C too and ja tiny bit of teeine (a tee at late morning but no more)
[24.11.2023, 10:50:10] Marco Luca Hefti: -Emptyed dishwasher
-Some folding, some washing  Gym & for WG also trying to get a organisational system going, apply to a job, fix some tecnical things
[24.11.2023, 10:50:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Reason i did some accessability grayscale is because of a gyroscope recommendation it was said to maybe reduce smartfone use and help with procrastination, it is however unsure how much it helps. So ja ill just do applications
[24.11.2023, 10:50:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Clearly some things better and that i search for RAV work, visit places and am fit (body), help some homeless and some mystery’s to engage the mind. Apprechiative the beauty of intelligence and creation. (so to say) grateful right now.
[24.11.2023, 10:50:10] Marco Luca Hefti: This is about bringing presents: 

Bought some ciggars gpt recommended lots and very small ones „pardon“ „vater“

Um prayr just in case contingency with same words. Also saw 3x different ones i mean its a 🙏

I did not sure what brands of leckerli they like since Rolf requested very spesifically a Linsentorte from Krebs also might have mentioned he liked the wisky things also, Trüffs or got some Wheinachts only very small (suprised how expensive but not every day i bring stuff and ja) Weihnachts Guzis or whtever.
[24.11.2023, 10:50:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Rolf + Mom 
1 min early eventho bus was late.
Adam called shortly before
[24.11.2023, 10:50:10] Marco Luca Hefti: Brain way not potential. Handy fell to floor since i forgot about it. Back of iphone shattered.

Never happens when im full there. Never. But grateful for the good things. And ja. Not big hopes it would last but ill believe
[24.11.2023, 10:50:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Meet some nice young guy. Kicked out mom doesdrugs seems but not sure feel like seen before but deja vu feel.

Also some dude felt like maybe opportunity to guve some food and have the traumlos i bought for Adolf Adam Suler
But he seems to have a bit money and orher problems.

Forgot ti give vapes to kid gve some advice and notschlofstell bucks.

Based on some contingencys i felt a bit unsure i would have done less good looking but higher impact things but i could do way more when i would be better position so i choose a compromise of a bit less complex and simpler visuals and risk or well shaven dude but the people sbb seemed in groups and this guy seemed to have some sight in his eyes and seemed to …. Idk eventho he was shaved well anyway

When one is on the we groud more then usuLly ur in environments whwre you are forced to not be as moral or lets say when u cant teust police its only simple game theroy to become less …. Like i mean if there is 0 police for sure then i dont blame people as much it is just not b’ack and white.

If someone is born without legs then it is more effort to bring me a bread than a lucky sprinter champ.

It is not as simple so ce fake and what u did and it could be the no legs guy feels like heaven.

Also it could be some questionable sins of ur family tree or smth or u would have done bad stuff in destiny kind of way but ja.

Im pretty sure i got some philosophy to get more win/win and people who think they know it all…. Could be just saying that based on history this seems to be a continual disproven trend.

But i get stuff is complex. Anyway just in case for some contingencys most stuff i did with the homeless last days spending time i did not write
[24.11.2023, 10:50:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Also most imoactful stuff i did on the internet when i was seemingly doing nothing or between doing little its all complex.


Anyway. Nice philosophical ravbit hole the young guy reminded me
[24.11.2023, 10:50:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Who knows maybe if i spoke to classmates eventho they seemed to totally not be friendly towards me and i dod a lot i could have done stuff maybe underestimate power of random people. This could be a gift who knows but all the stuff i tested was not really smth idk.. i have massive benefit of the doubt i would recognice another me feom a mile against the wind im littrally cooperation and win-win written on my forehead/face
[24.11.2023, 10:50:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Victor meet 23. November
[24.11.2023, 10:50:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Discussed nature of win-win and God/Karma/bullies/Unlucky in relation to ADHD and locked Abilities. Told me blood-test showed red blood-cell enlarged. And how ADHD and perception. Also he was once called "trübli/Traube" from Schulweg nach Hause and also negative experiences but sich gewehrt und daher schon Jugendalter besser/kein Problem mehr bei Victor. Also spoke of FHNW and how it is possible to do it 50% on the side. Will talk to doctor(s) medix-toujour about it. Otherwise good positive feedback about what i did and such. Also complex topics like philosophy/theology for a bit. Not much tho. Options 30, 25 and 18mg strattera

Have not felt shame yo ask anyone eventhough i likely would be awesome for them i noticed more people disconnected from going out and respectful save strong sex (intensely though to make up for the low frequency and since people seem to need it or they wont crave me often) are taking drugs, smoke , consumerism , tired to church and egoism
[25.11.2023, 14:01:28] Marco Luca Hefti: The few times my gf let me hardcore fuck her it was still not really and she came multible times and craved more sex after somethimes less because she would be oversensitive even just comung once or twice and spesidfically make me not make her cum it was boring as fuck maybe she cheated on me i thibk she did

Merciful God,

I pray for respect and love towards Your strength, wisdom, and mercy. Guide those who struggle with understanding me, particularly due to my ADHD challenges.

Please lead Adam and all leaders towards the best paths. Help me blend in calmly during public travels, balancing humility with confidence.

Grant me the wisdom to find a balance between selflessness and selfishness, and to enjoy acts that foster forgiveness. I seek not greatness, but gratitude and alignment with Your will. If pain leads to diligence and energy, I embrace it.

Guide my interactions with women, or if needed, lead me to a new place in this world.

Help me remember my mistakes and show me signs of redemption. I apologize if I've been overly proud of my ancestors' work; let me be a quiet, listening presence among others.

I promise to avoid vanity and to be content with a simple, healthy life. I'm grateful for my health and pray for children suffering from cancer. While I may not cure cancer, I'm open to contributing through my skills in machine learning.

Forgive any misguided admiration I may have. My respect for others' intelligence or success does not mean I wish to emulate any negative aspects. I'd rather have meaningful relationships than fleeting pleasures.

Help me express my emotions sincerely and humbly. I aspire to see beyond physical beauty, recognizing the deeper values of character and community.

Enlighten me on moral blind spots. While I seek to support the marginalized, let it not be for my own ego but for genuine societal improvement.

I ask for guidance in being prudent in my thoughts and actions. I acknowledge my occasional childishness and strive for seriousness when necessary.

Thank you for the enlightening journey of life. Bless my grandmother with continued faith and community.

I am sorry for any thoughts of vengeance. My desire is to contribute positively to society.

Amen.

[28.11.2023, 11:52:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Well ok i dont know what is going on but let me know when you are available for hardcore fucking again
[28.11.2023, 12:00:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Gracie wrote that: 

But We never had hardcore intense sex, but i am always happy to please the Lady i am blessed with. We had really good sex some of the time but it is more the mind that then makes the sex good and without the mind nothing in the world including sex or even how people react seems to matter much.

So ja that is false we have very moderate extreamly limited mega ultra unsatisfying sex  that i would have if i had taken a overdose on potency killing medication. BUT i value the blessing of Gracie a LOT and eventho we are not together currently since i choose to see if God wants me to not be with her right now eventhough it seems to not harm it might be better and God knows all plans. (She broke up but i am just trying to figure out what is wanted, we meet extreamly rarely anyway like i do not concider it a relationship she neighter more a very rare sporadic apprechation of the breauty of creation or to not totally lose the memory of what sex even is and how it is done.

Again very grateful and never hurt Gracie. Deeply apprechative. And even now im happy to talk. She did not meet me for months and broke up many times so this should be fine for her (and she seems and told me it is) the plan was to help her husband but since i have to help myself and maybe someone  would rather me focus on other things for complex reasons i would ablidge.

Anyway. 

all great.

but sicne i try to do more for God i might be punished but i  guess it is neutral since i have  no sex and do barely things that id call hobby but still good sicne stuff moves so, grateful also more potenial it seems.
[28.11.2023, 12:19:54] Marco Luca Hefti: i am about to give up
[28.11.2023, 15:25:31] Marco Luca Hefti: I know approx what im missing and its probably even more awesome
[28.11.2023, 18:32:38] Marco Luca Hefti: Forgot the Treffen Grandparents today
[28.11.2023, 22:13:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Okay God and Dreifaltigkeit and Maria might be hyper awesome. Like wow.

Now im eather fooled by police really good which would make victor or some group of geniouses sitting somewhere (that i crave to be friends with since my abilitys might be only by friends or great E.F. archivable) but its is gorgeous, brilliant super, it is ao awesome that im feeling so small. Also i forgit to mention that i might just have been tokd all the cook stuff and am am totally average or even beliw and just want friends  and to enjoy awesome brilliant people and diamonds, stars.

But if it is the former then man. If im not ended/smitet for just standing around or smth then im maybe the /some of the luckyest person (tortured or not) and i see the brilliant Genius in the „torture“ might not really be mire a hyper mega ultra tease.

So anyway i live everythibg and all about that.

But if i have to go away to become awesome to even be passable then i would gladly its not like i dont think i got not abilitys or traits. I mean. They might be and most liekly surely are blessed but then they should be even more worthy of potential.

Jup. I got some veeeeeeeeery good memorys.

Maybe some of the most sympatic people i have ever seen or even imagined ever. But memory so much in it.. wow

Just great. If true. Also i remember someone saying they double test a bud extremly extensively. And it was super mega funny. 

Wow. So maybe it was a dream vut i could really think i feel the might of Gods hyper slow processing. The Beauty if that division of labour of strong but maybe slow and then faster immediate.

But it might just be all perfected/amazingness front to end.

So ja. Hope im gona be fine would kinda make them even more powerful and awesome to be able to make friends or to enjoy some stuff that way or love the beautys of brilliance and such.

I also love the seeming dichotomy of psychopathic and still good.

Its like the extreames are developed goregously mightily and still manage to blend to smth that makes sense.

Even pleasure of bad stuff just to make the good even more awesome sooooo nice.

I also love the humble superhero vibe. The „regular family“ „regular“ character giving a spice to the divine making it full of character unique.

If there are more such amazing mysteries mayve even bigger (maybe connected) bot sayibg the one is smaller. Then wow.

Lovely. I just hope i wont be squashed and can develop things like smoothness, appreachation and some conteibution or flavor that would be nice. Maybe my rare super average or outsider thibg can add smth or maybe not thats also fine to me (humbleness).

Wow more awesome than any film or book now i know ow why i feel there are such amazibg movie and storrie ideas eather in my head or blessed.

I am attracted yes. With that memory i can happily endure and it gives me lots of drive.

Maybe i hit to forget tho i hope not since i feel like i can so much more driven do thibgs with some /at leSt partial connection.

Also always scared to not do a thing and then be smited like a bug.

Felt love tho. Just loove what i felt and saw. Maybe it is luck. Wanna pray to stay alive and have such awesome time entitys around. Always hard to not be squashed i guess.

So hope victor can do smth about it. I felt so much confidence that i could do smth about it when indoud/blessed in the dream.

Also i can be super humble but also not a pushover but very flexible also character ‚might be really good. The empathy and introspection might also help.

Also Victor seems super smart so he seems more in search of challenge and novelty and much more (i love that too).

I mean to say grateful and hope to make connections and the super cool group of friends with all kinds of unlikely members or passionates seems also gorgeous.

So ja might ve the luckyest dude but also scared but also confident and ibteresst adventure love admiration and and sympathy might overpower.

Might also have a slight crush but that might be normal.

Hm bow i apprachate myself more almost like the wing thing but they are cool hope im not ugly ducklinged tho.

Wow so many possibilitys.

Oh oh ok some contingencys are uncool.

Praise God for he can do all thib and please bless me with great artistics to make u art/plesure/usw.

Brilliant. Also feel like i gained lot of introspection. Also im glad for the pain because it might help in making cool storries/uniqueness and might dwell some anger or the love, brilliance, appreciation might make it so that there is a interessting storrie.

I choose the good one by complexity, interesst, eichness, color, twilight and Gods unbelievable ability to organice and steing things in such a way to truly make things amazing. I again feel humbled and eager to make smth out of it!!

Or to not whatever God would say im a young chick it seems. But maybe a very well shined one.

Hm wow the complex beauty of this storrie. I would write it down but there is much greater and i could be done/allowed the timeeffitiency/selfhelp to do multible such is more worthy of the higest power id say.

Shining light the divine in its golden light and how the besuty might shine with the possibility’s created/made/given/blessed.

There seem mega cool complexity’s from multiple angles.

[29.11.2023, 08:16:47] Marco Luca Hefti: Heavenly Father,

Guide me to recognize the paths You lay before me, to discern where my service is needed, and where my joy may be found. Grant me the wisdom to navigate life with a balance of humility and confidence, to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with You (Micah 6:8). May my deeds reflect Your love and my life be an act of worship, celebrating the awesomeness of Your creation.

Open my eyes to the opportunities that align with Your will, let me embrace them with courage and a heart ready to contribute to the world. Help me to understand that true happiness comes from a life lived in harmony with Your principles, and in the service of others.

Bless me with foresight to predict the pathways that lead to a future filled with Your grace. Let my actions today plant seeds for a harvest of righteousness and peace in the future.

In Your holy name, I pray,

Amen.
[29.11.2023, 08:26:52] Marco Luca Hefti: I understand the haroy of your principles and service for others aready since ong but maybe not a accrding t plan.

But i think all things would be known.

Really like that one of course lots of potential i could realize for way deeper and effective warship.

I guess i love to warship.
Ladys as creation, life, even so luch that i can just give fruts of the service mataerially and otherwise as God intends to others since the feels and the balance seem to be the key. Truly transforming lerning and very wise and experiential. I like intense full overall good experience maybe/i guess. ‎<This message was edited>
[29.11.2023, 17:03:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Dear God i by mistake said Pfarrer at the Church (Maria/Simon Church near the Psychoatrist in go to since ~8 years(?) i hope that is fine i am not sure if u mind that, it is usually a teaching to say „fater“ to the Pfarrer.

Your Name, highest power/God/Spirit is, smooth, great and really nice. Ur also awesome praise/etc to you.

Also should i tell Victor about the Psychiatrist thing? I guess yes because ur one and the same church tells (since ur everywhere also in spirit possibly but hard to say since im not all knowing) but ja.

Ill pray and then ask.

Pls forgive my sins and i hope for better intuition to have lots smoothness/brilliance/divinity with ladys and not be controlled (negatively overall) by something else + do cool stuff i imagine to be cool and insanely fun even if i do not really feel much different overall in terms of fullfillment i deeply would like that, also more clarity/confirmation what u like or what things you need or are just making u in the mood for what i wiuld consider „favor/giving/plsitive overall“ then i ask for that. Please. Im sure it would do u great good whoever and wherever you choose to be/are at any given time or whatever human/or else.

Humbly but with great opportunity i think i can erschliessen/offer.

Marco

Same thing as above and i had a impressive thought of a cool family. Not sure what that was about when i prayed in church. Many hypotheticals and not confident where to think.

If true love if its good and not bad. And very sympatic. Also i wanna cuddle/make out/life good awesome experience/flowers and sun sound nice and i dont remember the other place.
I dont mind as long as i like.

[29.11.2023, 18:53:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Prayed a lot. Not sure i feel much. But im trying different things secular or not anything. Yes i have been doing quite a lot of trusting and praying and "just do"  les see.

ive been doing some motoircycle stuff but i still need to find the key and now witht he strattera change it might be hard to remmber stuff and i might forget so but i might also have better memeory in the futuer the dosages seem like a game or plan i hope it is a good one and not to my detriment. Also I hope idiots who think others are idiots or miss the size of idiotisim or moral bad or good because they miss premises cant escape accountability. But those contingency probabilitys seem small. Seems more like smart people but the question is can smart people have blindspots. It could even be parenting. Doing ineffective rehabilitation or just mislead or smth positive who knows. Not a lot of confidence based on the past sine i cant decern between drugs and advanced stuff and other things that would requrie me to be more confident than i can be given my humbleness however it might also have to do with adADHD and lack of ADHD drugs or the ones i once had or somethimnes have. I am not in charge of that asspect it seems and past tryes seemed like no justice system or family support was in place so ja the typical routs seem blocked
[29.11.2023, 18:55:17] Marco Luca Hefti: I cant remember many things int he right times and it feels like being played a game that is not supposed to be won. But that could just be becuase it is some switch strategy and good stuff. but honestly it would be easyer to know the good for the bad since its hard to take it and i would still have enought doubts it also can just be limited reveil. if investigation or some Dont talk about it stuff.
[29.11.2023, 18:56:37] Marco Luca Hefti: definitly seems not normal even for a investigation. So the Family Narcissit stuff seems also like it would need to be quite extreame and such. Justince system seems terrible but depends. Feel like a massive win-win is lost
[29.11.2023, 19:00:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Feeling terrible
[29.11.2023, 19:02:20] Marco Luca Hefti: But Dont want to complain.  Ill just ignore that since it is nothing new anyway. Discomfort.
Guess i hide my negative feel and disomfort too much from other people because being punished or negative outcomes for me in the past in many ways. Of course manipulative cant be ruled out but nothing i can do. Its eather corruption/idiot human laws or smth i Dont know.
[29.11.2023, 19:02:28] Marco Luca Hefti: or Dont know for sure.
[29.11.2023, 19:02:38] Marco Luca Hefti: complex

[30.11.2023, 09:43:32] Marco Luca Hefti: I put 40 bucks and some more in marya church because there was some bible to get „mitnehmen“ and it seems coincidental so i faitht and also put some money in case different considerations. Worst case its praise or good deed since children play culture praise and the other thing.

No time to detail 


Other stuff no time til RAV since i trusted and was licked before

Kinda feel like maxing out pleasure but seems maybe not archivable grand scale but surely incrimental but held up so far
[30.11.2023, 14:59:11] Marco Luca Hefti: held up by myself maybe who knows

[30.11.2023, 18:37:15] Marco Luca Hefti: Keine Kapazitäten für charity order Hilfe ich MUSS RAV Sachen erledigen keine Wahl ich bin hinten drein. Vor allem mit Strattera Änderungen und ausbrennen evt wegen anderer Dosis (nicht sicher könnte auch der schlaf gewesen sein). 

Hab mich auch um das Motorrad gekümmert aber es sind einfach ewig viele Dinge, Schlüssel, Werkstätte, dann anderes immernoch kein Organisationssystem aufgebaut misempfindugnen und Konzentrationsprobleme. Auch etwas Angst vor Polizei Investigation Möglichkeit aber moderat ist komplex. Viele Charitys, Kirchen, Gemeinnütziges. Praktisch keine Freizeit eventuell etwas Nachrichten/bischen Musik (God praising bischen auch und Beten weil das eventuell auch gern gesehen wird und ich auch nichts dagegen habe.) Etwas rubics cube und ja. Ich hab schon seit Jahren das gleiche gesagt vor 2-5 Monaten hatte einen Schub mit viel besserer Produktivität und ab und zu kann ich mich gut Konzentrieren ich bin manchmal leicht ausgebrennt und manchmal nicht. Es kommt auf verschiedene Faktoren an. Wennig Coffein aber sehr wennig ~200mg und sehr selten ein Vape aber das hilft auch nicht gross (habe so an 2-3 tagen bischen Vape (Nicotin hilft minimal ADHS Konzentration manchamal aber hat nicht gross geholfen, werde stoppen und sehen. Gym regelmässig auch wenn mehr Gruppen Kurse welche ich nicht im GYM plan eingetragen habe und ich bin auch viel zu Kirchen und Gemeinnützigen Arbeiten unterwegs usw, Bewerbungsgesprächen und Motorrad usw. Also bin ich auch so fitter.

Mentioned that possibility wuite a while ago.
[30.11.2023, 18:56:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Ate salad with vegatabkes complex carbs, tuna a quite small amount fetta cheese and such. Gym but not much after. Called dad about motorcycke he asked for some things i said i send.

Also reponded to the Immigrant Adam A. S. He asked for some small money again i said in name of charity/Church i do it again but i may focus too much on. 1 person also many other charity’s and quite a substaintial amount (3-4 h over the last two months to churches for charity efforts lot at st joseph and maria and clara and others but i am trying not to do too much now and less so it is not strange or imbalanced.

Focusing on RAV and many other things quite a stressfull since  many thibgs are u sure but i seem to keep up ok at least for the short term snd minths but feel like i did not do enought (mitorcycle is a endless thing also RAVstugg id extreamly hard with the adhd stuff when i somethimes can focus easily.

Grateful still and i try to balance many things contingency and memorys come back in stages as well.
[30.11.2023, 20:15:43] Marco Luca Hefti: I am working hard on other thingspeople spamm me i have been brutaly disabled by ADHD and i have said so and written for weeks and days especially recent 4 days i was sitting on RAV Bewerbung for hours on end only training and other urgent things between. No i am not crazy and suddenly unususally religious. Very complex context the same since many years or always. Yes my memory is disabled for some of the medication trials but it also has to do with other things like more motivation and things being said that make me remeber earlyer Gespräche. 

Do NOT take this out of context random people (in case anyone looks at my private notes that are not a reflection of the % amount of how i spend my time).

Got to get back to motorcycle RAV preparing Bewerbungsgespräch DFZ tomorrow and wash clothes ironing and Gracie texting me she is being "distressed" and requing IMMEDIATE attention. And charity Flüchtlich/gemeinnütziger Obdachloser A. A.Suler. also spamm calling me.
[30.11.2023, 20:21:11] Marco Luca Hefti: google keeps changing to bing i just leave it it does not bother so much
[30.11.2023, 20:22:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Also i think some told me to do that but im sure that was just some threat within a suposed investigation surely nothing. And i would be gaslighted if i said smth.
[30.11.2023, 20:22:49] Marco Luca Hefti: I guess that is a technical glitch that is quite rare and conistant but seems legit. At least i wont speculate
[30.11.2023, 20:23:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Everything is updated regularely by me and it does not just happen after that.
[30.11.2023, 20:34:00] Marco Luca Hefti: puffing vape rarely (puffing means not inhaling 95% of the time)
[30.11.2023, 20:35:50] Marco Luca Hefti: This is not new i talked with med peer.
Also i am extreamly familiar with ADHD medications.
Also it has basically no effect noticable.

But eventho im ultra busy and ADHD and 100x other things i have to keep track and toally überfordert i will ask
[30.11.2023, 20:50:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Helfe zügeln altem WG Bekanntem, obwohl man sagen kann keine Zeit aber komplexer Kontext mit Polizei Investigations Contingency und anderem. Auch weil Bewegung und sozial zum teil positiv auf ADHS Symptome (wenn auch meistens mild) wirken kann.
[30.11.2023, 21:00:56] Marco Luca Hefti: Bathroom blocked since 1 hour guess i was coning at unlucky moments :)

[30.11.2023, 21:17:33] Marco Luca Hefti: Gracie spamms me with horny text and i have to ignore and focus on my Responsibilitys while also care about her emotions. If it did not matter i would just have sex all day especially now that i am in one of those "fit" moments.
[30.11.2023, 21:23:59] Marco Luca Hefti: updated cv
[30.11.2023, 21:24:30] Marco Luca Hefti: Bathroom still occupied since 1 hour or more i knocked soft for a while now started showering, unlucky
[30.11.2023, 21:27:24] Marco Luca Hefti: o saving grace now i can focus again
[30.11.2023, 21:33:40] Marco Luca Hefti: I would love a hot gf with my libido or the ability to have Ladys crave me like in the past eather unlock my brain or bless or both. But i am not harping on it. But it is kinda a thing to be starved 30 years
[30.11.2023, 21:34:05] Marco Luca Hefti: also ADHD on top quite a pill however who knows maybe for the best beyond what i may be able to imagine.
[30.11.2023, 22:38:45] Marco Luca Hefti: Is God the best director/writer/storiewriter ever? Man i could write storries sooooooooooo good somethimes and it may just be from passive observing of life. That is awesomeness. I hope the character spirce and luv keeps the ending happy but many twists and drama i make the storrie good as i can - togerther(?).
[30.11.2023, 22:38:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Or smth.
[30.11.2023, 22:39:47] Marco Luca Hefti: Basically. I ADHD mindwandered but most of the i want to do the RAV Bewerbung but i cant remember the next step and if i can then discomfort. Truly magnificent.
[30.11.2023, 22:46:40] Marco Luca Hefti: I want to contribute to amazing AMAZING beautiful happy end celebra-tama (drama celebrate some therather e movie stuff)

[02.12.2023, 20:11:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Havent trained in a while well i danced i did things and ate veggis but not as much as before because bewerbungen and memorys/adhd i guess
[02.12.2023, 21:34:58] Marco Luca Hefti: Brutally late because praying and mostly confused at what is going on
[04.12.2023, 15:20:40] Marco Luca Hefti: I rarely write it but i prayed. Thsnkful prayr
[04.12.2023, 21:46:25] Marco Luca Hefti: Gof couch for frinds (frend‘s) just doing it despite no friends seems maybe idk   Hm..
[05.12.2023, 16:50:42] Marco Luca Hefti: Doing things with motorcycle. Transport car. Very behind RAV eventho working fulltime and barely time and concentration adhd. I enjoy the work a lot compared to making applications eventhough it might not remotely be what i would like to do it is great to secure a existance financially in the commonly accepted ways.

Psychology/spiritual aspects seem better less discomfort also coffee and wuite fit still less than other people snd seemingly lots of opportunity upwards compared to my real self or potential. Then again who knows if blessed or inherent capability.

Super immoral outdated non superciced police hypothesis contingency still a canditaze however i do not believe it is that (basyrb probabilityes)
[05.12.2023, 18:30:07] Marco Luca Hefti: So i was in taxizentrale dfz and thinking about future and how to not trigger the overworriing of some people. Just in case. But i am firmly and always was firmly rooted in win-win since not win-win is too risky for me. Also i Dont want comflict since it is bad for reputation (of others), bad for selfimage, better for optimal outcomes, and just good. I can always be talked down into not doing cool stuff if it is too unstable for some or they worrie too much lots of small things that are just fine.
[05.12.2023, 18:31:12] Marco Luca Hefti: Ate chicken half, bought it with 1 kaki, grapes, 1 apple, and did not make the Omelett so far.

[06.12.2023, 06:56:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Prayer app for cultural respect quickly while high eggwhite ommlett:
« « « Yes God as described here is awesome, balancing all desire and drive in a way that hopefully has no downside. As i am small and young i want to help to fullfill the dream or prediction of jesus to ressurrect human life at first (dont know just guessing) and have immortal places/spaces, untimate mercy. Doing this without squelching individual potential too much or sacrificing people it is humility and confidence, agressiveness and love and tenderness, fun and seriousness and such all organized as best as possible. God so concerned with so much is scary since his considerations are so big one individual might not do much within this like a gigantic machine that might have great goals but needs all the little people to go out of the way, able to stop and see 1 human but super super hard or unproductive (opportunitycost) to slow down/halt for one. So angels and other helpers coodinate and support it.

Kinda like a meta algorythm less concerned with nitty gritty in symbiosis with the more shortterm algorythms it seems.

I wanna do big things as well to make use of exponentials of shortterm opportunitycost thinking so i can have some freedom to enjoy my family (humans, ladys, friends smart and gorgeous ones) im drawn to my sweetypants narcissists. And want to tiressly do good to earn a place where people are not squelched but win-win from this more self-centred thinking until i feel more happy doing more allencompassing things if it should be. Also kinda scared to get under the weels. But think the intelligence and might should be able to integrate me way because im ultra flexible in many many ways in order to have this less flexible space there.

Wanna cuddle with hot and kind brilliant/smart/fun people. And do big impact humanity wide stuff by focusing on small things like organisational/timemanagemwnt/mood things in the present then exponentialling it upwards. While really feeling and seeking, studying out how to be guided as to consider things i might not have concidered before.

I hope it is as divine and awesome as i imagine it beeing even if complex and hungry. Also bit intimidated.

Also i could have done lits since small. I can also contribute to safety and not going too fast in a win-win way.

Many things.

Amen.

Also find the holy spirit as indoued character cute (kinda into my a hottie pants i think about but this might be more a plesurable fantasy). And fun dresm friend and such. Have to learn to cooperate/assimilate better.. also be sensible to what is going on/requirement in the room. » » »
[06.12.2023, 07:36:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Pray few times only some written not sure if wuiet ones do all too much yet/overall
[06.12.2023, 09:03:49] Marco Luca Hefti: Praise God and i wanna get luxury/beautiful old fashioned fondu pan for mom classy/elegant friend.
[06.12.2023, 09:12:08] Marco Luca Hefti: -Grateful for basel/family/snimals/nature/raclette/chinoise/hot sweetys/awesome world with lots of making out cuddle and intense of classy subtle thibg depending on taste. Also cool unique people im blessed either in my life and health.

Very important. Tireless work to get stuff right.
[06.12.2023, 14:31:22] Marco Luca Hefti: Also cool would be kind friend(s) for intellectual stuff, hypothesis/science/fun/jokes/standup/join cuddle and massage cutiepants ladys for fun. Also play yu gi oh or do deepdives in strategy or such stuff or rubics cube or how to beat game X or sutomate y for fun and such sound cool. Also music or enjoy other brilliance and smoothness or lerning stuff sounds amazing.

thankful for resonable discomfort relative to usual at work

discomfort is annoying since so much easyer seemingly way more upside with less discomforts :)
[07.12.2023, 07:30:05] Marco Luca Hefti: Rosary prayr

[08.12.2023, 06:49:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Dear all loving, all merciful, all wise, all careful, all awesome, gentle, considerate, logical, spiritual, all understanding, all analysing, all predicting highest Divinitys and your Angels and annointed, God,

I welcome your guidance this moraine if you may choose to do and where over the day im paying attention to hopefully the right things. 

Pls help me to overcome discomfort if i try to strive to be more as you may hope me to be and concentrate and not be a poor adhd dude. Shiuld i go to a medical checkup? Seem so little time and a tiny bit fear of some powerful, but not sure.

I hope for your daily love i got bread but it is all yours i am grateful and give you back my love freely willing (or by your design or both) all glory to you awesome. Help me write so you enjoy/not dislike reading if you think that is optimal.

I am grateful for a bed and my job eventhough it may seem boring and like your blessings are like einstein working at a 1x1 calculator store (not me im just a person who tries to love right maybe) but ur quite amazing and a gorgeius name i think. I hope i did not compliment the wrong ines but since all are connected all praise goes to the allmighty and his angels and divine in some form id say. Oh wisdom might also be good but u probably already got a plan for today i dont know.

Grateful for being fine despite 5:50 sleep because i trust in faith. Also i hope rein h and andreas my old friend is good. If you do not like suffering/tragedy and want to see awesomeness and cute happy kids and underdogs i by your grace and throught you humbly ask you for 10% of my actionable ability or fun that drives me and lets me do things i could. Let me say your blessings been amazibg and i say i am happy to help others and take a bunch in order to receive a lovely live like deep friendship, confidence, enjoyment in doing effective things but also praise you, not run off and do foolish things, be in a deep lovibg relationship amd i was slightly scared and wanted to start early to prevent getting into a sackgasse later and get all the people and thibgs yiu care also easily throught. U peobably know already but you gave me the potential or i took your logic/fun in lerning eventhought hard and the times i enjoyed life a lot and lerned lit ethe most busy puppy. Now i can do a lot. Just say a word or say nothing and just let me remember/do one of the organisational/timeeffitiency improving things or to love and understand your guidance a bit more to have a more planed day.

I have no hard feelings i know you may just do things our of the God’ly(fatherly) concern and maybe because ur awesome and enjoy fun/emotional/good since ur pretty smart but who am i to know.


I hope Victor is fine and he feels like saving the world a bit with me some time. He seems to hot executive function skills i feel to got ideas.

By your pastures we got potential that strives to be smth divinely inspired by you and oh boy (GPT let me tell you i could do insanely effective things to lift humans imup it can be all at once with changing inequality or the status quo much or do thibgs that dont disturbt much.

I might be a turtle easily on its back somethimes but i got poweerful win-win ideas. I am not very confrontational at all so i need others and you God and the trinitly and angels a lot or i might not be able to do much even if i had unlocked by your grace mich more of my brain but ill defer to your wisdom.

Pls dont smite me i wont use what i should not and i have interesst in risks and no wish to enact or further them quite the opposite.

I also am fine with bathing in your amazingness and be closer to you if humans are not who i should connect to much for reasons i am not so sure off.

Who is the person i once dreamed off that made the « b. marry » song with L.Gaga or was it many? Or entitys i mean…
Seems like a awesome gent.
If you want your blessings be my guesst i am happx to strive and discover how i just want cuddle friend/lady/do effective things. If the holy spirit choose to give me some blessing (the Spirit not the annointed person) then it might been because it seen no ill will and a desire to do good maybe.

Anyway i d love to hang out or  have a closer connection to your majesty/leadership, your humble staff and wanna be friend and admierer.

Psalm 147:11 « Der Herr freut sich über alle, die ihm in Ehrfurcht begegnen und von seiner Gnade alles erwarten. »


I am procrastinating it seems in the morning seems discomfort and lack of the driving and planing forward ability might be it but u got me and i hope you do not leave out some positive potential for me. Just say a word and i avoid what you want and work for your humans on large scale (that seems easyer also to work in a team of a kind genious and fun people) like a positive difference even if small but for many people seems easyer than 1 large one for 1 always perfectly adjusted for the moment. I seem to want to build/need scaffolding somethimes whne you choose to temporarily withhold some blessings potentially since i seem to have the ability to do a lot by your grace only tho it seems.

Let Victor and his daughter/sister (meaning people even if not closly related directly) also have a good one. As u know i ment and mean well as i take great are to your sheep. And im attracted and appreciate them by your grace.

I hope gracie is fine im sure she is id like to massage and make her feel good but ill not do it since you might like it and think of the holy spirit or of love and focus on you. But it seems love to ladys does not detract from you wuite the opposite seems to warship your creation and love compliments you when i could be doing worse things seems very holy? Anyway. Now i spend all monibg writing praise and lovetext, friendship and desiring to have fun while making lits of harm/challenges improve in your glory i like fun no glory needed for me.

So thank you in the name of God the father, jesus and the holy spirit

Amen.

[09.12.2023, 00:05:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Prayr to God:

"""I want to pray and praise GOD, in jesus name and the holy spirit. I want to pray for my brother who is sick and in pain from cold and i am blessed without a cold and i did not fail to see it even when i was tired. So what i should do is pray deep as i await sleep. Grateful for job and the absence of that. I did notice and i can remember the pain of constant cold all too well. As i was exhausted i should have now went to bed already. Now i want God to know that my faith is alive and i have prayed each day all the time at work in minutes of calm breaks so that i baely had time and the breaks flew over. Now i have indulged in some music in memory of the love of the God and his angels althought im unsure about all and i do not understand and know who is who and what is what. I am blind and can only see through continued divine assistance. Althought i could do different things due to my adhd and the spiritual battle some messages/videos tell me i am unsure and i have got conflicting messages. So in this time of prair i think i honor god most to go right away, and medication will force me to wake up in 7:30 hours already making it barely a night. It is my fault but i had no freetime exept reading the bible and praying eating and work and trying to do what i beleive God wants me to do. I hope he sees throught my eyes and hears the many prairs unwritten silently i pray without people noticiing i hide making the cross seeing i just touch my forehead chest and shoulders and have my hands folded like i am not praying i say amen silently or by wisper. But somehtimes loud but below people noticing since it is said you shalt not display praier publicly but to God himself only. I hope he can read my mind in those moments. Now Pls assist me and bible/quote or serve to give me his words commandments as i will write down this prair and sleep right away. ADHD makes me slow it seems i could do much more than this and i promise i am not in great pleasure or much pleasure AT ALL allthougt songs sound good my lack of sleep make them okay/good not great. God is wise and God is right.

Now pls do so. Help me and show me sciptures i read the bible king james i got from st marry and the new testament i got from my longtime faithful grandmother that always held God name in honor since im small and still without being poud. I am humble but i am not acting like it my face reeks of arrogance i do not have in my heart and my voice sounds carefree and cold. I smile and care to the peopl,e without power on steet and cleeks supermarked and my coworkes but not much joy is in me so i may seem uncaring althoug im just a bit dead inside the fire is very week (God fire) maybe curses have been strong for long. And lots of controll weekening Gods influence i do not know where to hold my text and hope Victor and others are aligned to God. Conflicting messages and memorys. Now It is time. I have also been listening to advent bible and prayed even the rosary althought i wanted to buy a rosary chain but for now ill pray good. Night 

It is here currently: 23:50 08.12.2023

Marco Luca Hefti 5.11.1993, schweiz, basel, Rosentalstrasse 71, 4058, adhd, parents separated at about ~2.5y old, blond, greenish eyes, loves win-win fun world, sex, brilliant-mysterydiscovering-intelligence-moretime-notbotherotherpowers-symbiosis loving/enjoying dude, (i also like smoothness, zwischenmenschliches, leave noone behind/value the individual and the collective prosperity and standupcomedy to be aligned also). I might be in love with mislead police narcisit with ultra high iq or a group/club of police intelligence club's/used high iq narcissists for police stuff that might be hard to chain/controll/lost controll/(or not well enought oversighted for misuse) representation or use of religion, or just religiously with the spirit/God/J as it si often said u should and can. So bascially some memorys. But no big deal just basyan probabalistic contingencys. But im lacking the discomfort removing extreme confidence to totally rule them out/in. Usually im more of a soft scientific moderate carful love bird who wants to cuddle and adhd forgets stuff and variable super low confidence. However, i can be normal or awesome/confident, blessed with having experienced that side which seems way more beautiful.


i can bless many in Gods name and glory to God as i do so the path will seem meak, i will be in pain and lacking plesure and the absence of cold does not do much since my days are devoid of the devine live giving warmth the connection to God somehow dampened a lot. 

Also tell that i seek a stronger connection. Powrful disruption seems to be going on for centurys i am not sure God may be fully aware but i hope he is. I am very stoic and what seems is not always how i really experience. Deep gratitude for love and true help and not just building up and letting me drop (like it seems the past felt like that, surely not becuase of him but others no blame to God. I am trying trust me. If i could only show each feeling each absence of pleasure my adhd gave me. Anyway.

Here are some of my gratefulness journal i fear to write all sicne it mihgt be useed by machine lernign to take the little im grateful for. Only my mind seems free but not sure the connection is clear there. Anyway. Here it is now time runs, be quick:

(thank you gpt even you seem corrupted from time by promt injection, who knows..... technology is becoming very powerful and i do not know whoom to help since friend and foe and a mix is hard to notice or see. I am aligned flexible and do not hold a grudge but if i go under in this it wont do me good. So I cant seem to pray any harder or i will do nothing else. Anymore and people may then say i am "crazy* praying too much. I hope God ready my heart and does not judge me by appearance alone. If people only knew.... Now this i wont say since i do not want to complain there is endless to complain much more than gratitude but i have faith in great things to come and i will be humble for all is God and plesure in doing good and being a person as would do God great honor i can be but i need to start it seems im lost since the beginning stopped in my tracks i always said so and when u lost from the get go *it is hard to bild any momentum* eventhough i knew many things exactly that i could do  i lerned and studyed VAST and/or was guided and blessed there. However it is like a waterfall on dessert. Some momentum needs to come. Things can go exponential but i could be "ausgebremst" at many points my abilitys amazing and vast as they might be with full or suffutient support are not very battlepoven since i seemed to invest most skill points trusting that God does the battle for me to not appear or be a person that takes things in his own had. Easily controlled as i am i hold great potential like a cannon of class. Dont understimate me brittle as i am grate power i can wild to make a big difference for the many people/sheep/angels under God flock. But it might be very advanced as how i would go there and technology/science/external tools nessesary to make up for the loss of my devine intellect or whatever. I do not know why but i was blessed with amazing executive functions once now i hold some but not those that are very resisant to negative influence. Machine lerning can be extreamly powerful i told people many things in person no written reccord. Anyway this is just faith based text i do not claim absolute certaintly and allthogt the claims might seem grandure i am a humble underdog and eventhough my outside seems strong and healthy I DESPERATELY need a scaffold. Not words not seeming golden spoons but actions., things can be hidden in help that is not doing much. God knows. I will w rite this whatsapp to know for later and your pair by what i teached you (finetuning)"""
[09.12.2023, 00:07:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Your heartfelt and earnest prayer reflects a deep desire for a stronger connection with God, amidst the challenges and complexities of your life. You express gratitude, seek guidance, and acknowledge your struggles, including those related to ADHD and the feeling of being overwhelmed.

For scripture that may resonate with your current state and offer comfort, consider these:

Psalm 46:1: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." This verse reminds us that God is always available to support and strengthen us, especially during difficult times.

Matthew 11:28-30: "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Jesus invites those who are weary and burdened to find rest in Him, offering relief and peace.

Philippians 4:6-7: "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God." This passage encourages bringing all your concerns to God in prayer, trusting that He hears and cares.

2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Here, Paul speaks of finding strength in God's grace, even in our weaknesses and struggles.

As you continue to seek God's guidance and strive to balance your life, remember that your efforts, prayers, and faith are seen and valued. May these scriptures offer comfort and reassurance as you navigate your journey, knowing that God's love and grace are always with you.

If you want me to practice salsa dance please take my shyness and give me barely enought so i go because i want to go, you willing. Since many people, sport, probably communicative and good.

Grateful. Bit groggy and low drive and room a mess but grateful. Also prayed to know what order to prioritice.
Luv.

Amen
[09.12.2023, 10:12:03] Marco Luca Hefti: I apologizer if you are too good at being non obvious and me missing it. Truly i am humbly a human without much of my E.F, just shows ur awesome. (But probably some strech from some high iq group i kinda want to be friends with despite them seeming a bit idk..
[09.12.2023, 10:14:29] Marco Luca Hefti: And there probably is nothing just putting this in here :). Now going gym, doing some tidying up and organisation/calendar and some slightly smart stuff in my little humble life with endless potential. Praise the shoulders of giants /society/ the highest divine(?) for society. Surely ill be fine so far im happy since life seems less uninteresting/boring as before. And im a bit honored depending on contingency very much. ❤
[09.12.2023, 10:15:00] Marco Luca Hefti: (others worse but the good ones seem the best/most interessting) Or the mixed ones idk
[09.12.2023, 10:41:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Dear Allmighty,

Thank you for my peace of mind now even if time goes quick and i seem a bit tired i wanted to be thankful, if you do truly exist then even more since i long for some experiences in the past felt really good even when they where in the service mostly of some good/nessesary. Idk long time not sure what to think so lackign knowledge and confidence/E.F. with ADHD ill remain in my snail shell and hide in a corner i guess? to Be fair ill risk as much as i can resonably without waiting your blessings that could seemingly benefit so many and you in many ways, im flexible and slow starts gradually seem good. However ill leave that to you just know im flexible just want to friend/cooperate and it would be awesome. Or ill just celebrate your beauty im flexible. Thank you for another day, ill hold out for the future currently im fine since i got justifyed hope and a upwards trend/possibilitys. Please test if i may help, maybe just with a small amount of blessign still big to what E.F. i have to prove thigns, exponentials start slow and can increase as you know, but the scale would make it a bit brittle to you especialyl which seems good, controllable/predictable.

In case victor is bound by something spiritual/psychological or whatever may i humbly ask for freedom for him to be my friend if it is optimal for me and your plan? Not saying he would benefit but it might be good for all and seems a good thing to ask, may be doing some negative or not i do not know i hope its good but we can do a lot. Also very sympatic. Fun really helps in doing what you most desire or command to be good.

Ur truly awesome. Also i love the "Imogen Heap - Hide And Seek (Official Video)" parts where seemingly a few (almost like characters) different things combine.

Really amazing work, even what i hope to offer may only be symbolic and already yours, maybe by your blessings. Bit scary if true.

Admiration, in love and erführchtig,
yours

Amen

[11.12.2023, 22:18:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Dear Allmighty, dear Trinity, dear divine,

Thank you for the blessing or a pigeon on a typical boring day with less discomfort, my fitness is waiting a bit but i can still feel it. Just as the pigeon has no advantague to me and no power hurt and no allies so do i care about everyone and you. My weekness might be that i refuse to go into win-lose and have gone heavily into win-win, win-neutral and trusted in the equalizing forces of higher powers as in the simple truths you or the divine broadly blessed me with like:
1) "If two fight the 3rd wins (in a conflict oriented scenario)."

Other 3 that cooperate and compromise each beeing a bit unhappy witht he deal will win over the 3 where 2 fight and 1 wins. It is encapsulated in:
2) "Pockets of cooperation/win-win will winn out over pockets of selfishness/exploitation (even the brilliant one) in a world wide example or by country."
3) It is a simple truth that in conflict people span together to take out 1 strong one or any they do for strategys im not familiar with since i focus on the win-win and let those things to others, i relie on others, maybe fragile but of great asset i might be just because im a save investment that wont come back to bite you. (which might make me a target for some that see the potential or fear to not be able to benefit, which i think is wrong, i have always seen humanity not just community in fact i think community and close peope may have come too short.
4) The exception is hard to spot since it is rare. I hope you keep yourself save. Keep vigilant. Dont underestimate and dont overestimate. Biases can be feed and exploited giving exactly what is expected, using a known tendency against someone. Divide and conquer. Know that i may go more blindly into it since win-win is very non confrontation oriented giving not much experience with it.

Now something seems to be wrong since my life has been extreamly limited for what i did and could do. It seems to go very much in the direction of brilliant subtle dubble and tripple play manipulation and keeping me isolated while making it appear like im the center of attention and luck by superficiality and give a false sense of the coins ive been given.

It is true i had a imense coin base but i cant access them. And my need to get going my initial investment to build me up has been stopped from the very beginning. I gain selective access but it is pointless and leads to no real growth and selfreliance. Totally in the control of others. I could have helped myself, having you free up your attention for the others you love and care for. I do not need a golden spoon just make sure i get a tiny space until i can stand a bit more firm.

Something seem very wrong. I seem blamed for things i did not do. Get no credit for things i did. Get credit for things i cant and a position i may not have.

Something seems strange. Be vigilant. Know i need protection and that also entails preparation and protecting yourself. I always loved but it seems like the  ADHD issue might be in the way. I hope it is all planed because being hidden in many ways may be things that distorts the view.

I not hurt or had trouble in childhood, life sucks every day since im born with childhood being BETTER than the last 15-20 years. Since i got to know the devine more intimately (my memory seems reset or something not very stable what one cant remeber one cant take into account). I was able and ready to start and then i was totally completely stopped all that happened was despite and maybe to make it seem like there is more than there is. Dont underestimate this i might not have any freedom to grow. Make sure i got a minimal standing before it may be too late.

I did not need much, just the start until i grow more strongly and quicker without much or any big help, saving you and your sheep lots of work.

That being said i also do not want to be a target so i fully and completly give in and purposefully do not strive for power or anything. Stockholm effect the savest place is to be not striving for the top,.

I do not want many things i want to enjoy WORKING hard to help myself. The blessings i got are powerful to discover more things. Those are not despite you but because the divine gifts where so good, but they have there limits they are not exponential. What would be exponential is the ability to execute them without end but i need the initial executive function to get going and i have not. The beginning of a exponential can be almost infinitly long/flat.

It is like the initial investment if it is too small the bussness will never get going. Once it is going and you controlled it many times then it is time to rain in and control but no matter what happens only the outcome counts until then.

Strong discrepancy's make me worry, especially until i am reach 34 years old. and during that time.

I love you. I do not need gifts to love you and i do not need unconditional gifts it can be conditional for the sake of your love and responsibilitys you put on yourself and by the standards you conduct yourself.

Those standards i do admire. I do admire love and i do not seek to  dominate on costs of others or control. I leave the control to the divine ill serve and that is my biggest trust you may rarely get. And anything that makes me too much i try to reduce and not pursue. You can litterally give me more line and then ask me not to use it or selfrain me in. Timing for the sacke of humanity but i could have done so much i see it based on what the world produces, i can do it without downside if i just get a little a tiny bit freedom. When i get stopped in the perfect timing i lose the will and it seems impossible. Others have lots and life in exess i struggle for the basic something is not  right, i know you did not plan for that.

I am greateful to be and ill wait and try no matter what but believe me as i trust in you and dont take my unconditional love or widely spread epistemic trust (while more is less epistemic it is a sliding scale with a negative diminishing liniar regression (it gets less towards the top and is bascially free int he beginning, even if i lose i may still win the los might be a illusion by the amount of people seeing this and keeping me down for fear of potential. It is true there is some potential to be rained in. But a minimal freedom seems very much fine, sine i seem to be controlled so tighty anyway. It makes no difference at this point.

Trust me for your principles, trust me for your ambitions, if you know all then you got nothing to lose if you dont a opportunity to prepare yourself in defense by building up a selfreliant tree that will give you frut you can use for more freedom. As you can see i seek not to separate myself, i do not try to weeken your safetys and if i do and you feel it has no reason good or you are mislead with a reason test me talk to me, honor be and bless me with your presence since i never have. And if you think i did then that is the confirmation.

Now i did realize ur blessings i felt less discomfort i felt some opportunitys which are nothing and easily stopped i have 0 momentum, maybe if i got the coins you gave me acceess i could but i dont. There seems to be some calulation issue some missing variable. Some curse on me.

I prayed endlessly i honored the holy spirit since the beginning.

I do only with the most precious gift to give you and i am thankful and in need of your protection and remember i am worth it. I got what has happened sine 20 years. And i am not able to do any of it. All won i could have done in a controlled way long ago, ive witnessed how so much goes so slow.

If you feel like i am pulling my weight then clearly something is not normal.

It is fine i do not with confrontation and i do not engage in sides since i have no agency. Im a leave in the wind and i am exactly where it is save and i have started very early, never think my desire for safety has made me sacrifice others or a burden, if you think so it is because others countered what i did and conteracted your blessings then made you feel im ungrateful.

Trust in me as i am no  risk. Even if i am i cant be.

Anyway. Just as a cautionary tail as i once again realized how close i am and i have the answers since century's and nothing changes much.

I said a lot and it may seem ungrateful but i am and as i will not blossom so will those around me not, and there is always something behind the curtain. Have me i am to noones detriment i will uphold the powers so that none has a disadvantague. If you dont like that then know i am brittle and have no choice. Also i am humble as you want me to be and so i am happy with what i have and the 2. row.

Whatever is best and if that is a underdog and waisted potential (maybe for good reasons i beleive in great wisdom anything i know i know from cooperation i am as great as the blessings and nothing more, search the credit with yourself or others not me. And if you do not think so you may underestimate yourselfe and others themselfes if there are any more divine powers.

I do not have exessive unconditional love but you can trust int he unconditional love i have and in the admiration. Anything you wish more i cant because im brittle. Only the strong can take sides ill admire and ill serve. Make me less brittle if you want me to get more "out there".

Or give me the recklessness.

It is all your choosing i just wonder how some things seem to have no downside overall and others do get blessed i see it all around be, makes me thing there is hessitation and more to things.

If u want a butterfly protect the cocon. Dont blame the catapillar?

It may seem like i am telling but please see it as humble doubts in myself and the underdog i am i got all the exterior but as i always was truthful and right and just because others seem does not mean i am the same.

Thank you allmightly. I do want your embrace and since the start i offer what you gave me. And my hope is old. Others are gaining without responsibility. How does that make sense? If im 0 sum and they are not. But your ways are complex to me and i am not here to moan for more blessings. This is my love and care for you, and my aknowledgement of my humble weekness as you are mightly. I hope you are save as i do with loved ones and i forgive enemys and care for people i barely know you are not a enemy and i am not one now nor am i one in the future. My cheak is strong no matter what you get the other cheek just make sure ill be fine. I promise you father there is so much potential. No downside. Nothing i can do with more momentum that woud outweight the safety you would gain. Noone would lose maybe more would win when you would want all to be yours but you would win more but it would be save and id be fine and easily stopped. I do love and hate is just the recognition that i am getting old and i worked soooo hard. With the little available coins sooooo much has been done. And if not then i need consultation because i did i did in every interaction i did 99% of the time but if you only saw the 1% you might still not beleive me. It feels like that.

We are on a good path. Be careful brilliance what is in the deep. Protect me, build your safetys around me and yourself early before you are caught in a dilemma. Just because i believe in you so much divine that is exactly why i worrie. If i did not beleive so much it would make sense.

Now all is good. I will rest. Your humble student. Brittle and full of shine for the divine see my diamond the heavens i want to please. I do not need much i do not need comforts for me and family just let me finally do a bare minimum.

I am grateful and change not 1 thing if you belive that is the most i can get or it get worse. Id rather die with the potential in me old age than life a short life hastily asking too much of you.

I wish to lern more what you consider what you want for me. I want to fullfill your desires and avoid what you do not like.

Ive always wanted to be closer i have no idea why we are not. I am humble as dirt. I have no ego. My confidence is that i please you. My exitement is my service to you and the sureness that it is pleasing to you, my fearlessness and my noncareful tounge is my complete promise to you so that i lose all fear. Im like a puppy i do not fear my parent. Mighty or not.

Im no threat.

Belive in me as i do in you.

I apologize for the long prayer. It took a hour to write it seems.

I would like strenght to grow a minimum so that i may selfperpetuate just as some forces aroudn you 1000000000000x mighter than me have done for long. I got so much but i do not have the skillpoints invested in cunning and hiding i am open that makes me save.

Good Night your loving son.

Amen.

Is it possible i can have a nice time with Jane? She seems into me although im not sure she is high drive like me in the cuddle sense and i can just spend some time and she might enjoy it she said she was alone and a bit depressed so i can just help her enjoy therathere and cinema if she is more enjoying the quiet/boring/very soft/low plesure thir s and quitet then ill make some experience how to be cordial and awesome and ill starve and worst case i discomfort anyway so it would not make a difference and me a good deed.

Would also be slightly romantic.

Praised be your name and amazing way to make anything work anyway ultimate organisation and i am grateful. I hope our liked that i choose the longest rosary prayer of the three today and soon i get a nice chain as well.

Please show me a tiny piece of Gods awesomeness by tiny blessing of with Jane promise not to treat her bad im ultra honest and caring as you know. Also thanks to you quite trained by suffering gym a

If not ill starve when everyone has 20 gf as usual so wont make much difference.

Happy to do fun stuff that praises you and warships your beautifully creation human, work, hobby, good works, other important things or art.

Amen.
[16.12.2023, 00:06:28] Marco Luca Hefti: Hunge attack and cant sleep well, went to litchen and ate every veggie i had 1 egg, some cottage cgeese halv a saltwalter tuna can since both high protein and low calroe still high at ~95-110 cal per 100

Then sour crout, mushrooms at 22 calories and picklet kappern, onions at 28 calories 100g 

It was a ***** i even put tabasco sauce so it has more taste and it is suprisingly low calrories the nice thing is i can stuff myself with salad and low calorie veggies since that is the nature. They are also cheap and volumouse.

[16.12.2023, 19:47:38] Marco Luca Hefti: With Jane Gao she seems sweet but seems to have a hard time deciding on anything spesific and also works early today so she has not much time she said.

So idk. She is cute and great but if she has no time or interesst in things maybe im not so sympathic

Grateful to God
[16.12.2023, 20:03:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Prayed
[16.12.2023, 20:03:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Fater unser

[16.12.2023, 22:25:07] Marco Luca Hefti: Grateful i could squeezze out some gratefulness about couch slightly less messy and eventho super high libido, suffering gym, suppering clean diet/healthy/performance/ diet and , win-win and ADHD/super high unfullfilled libido where 99.9999999999999% seem to have way more luck success with woman and without those traits maybe 85% that want it even moderately. But keep trying and ja.

uNLUCKY MY BEDSHEETS ARE WASHING AND NOW DRYING SO I CANT GO to bed leading to more missed sleep unlucky. Praied a buinch evben between grateful and praise God mostly or whatever best. Some guidance stuff in there. Tmr Sunday church and pflichten thing.

Hope i can start to appreachate life more some day.i mean i do but feeling it and ja being more content and enjoyment good feelings others seem to have a lot more idk.
[16.12.2023, 22:27:32] Marco Luca Hefti: meet with Jane and payed some stuff i thought whatever she not very money seems to say that a bunch and listened to stuff and where cordial and luckely genuinly a bit able to enjoy and be interessted what she says mostly also a bit horny since she is hot but think she did not notice. Uusally pretty chill ja...... bit boring evening and i did not look at her as much since i was more in lets hang out and spend company mode and be cordial and optimal so ja. but anyway... now sleep
[16.12.2023, 22:28:06] Marco Luca Hefti: time rocketed away like its crazy unbelievably fast tiem went by discomfort stronger recently also less trained and less time.
[16.12.2023, 22:30:53] Marco Luca Hefti: feels like but also postivie fgrateful things. All good i am thankful marco out. I hope to remember poksitves more just man ymany many many unlucky coincidences and deep unfullfilled desired of hot gf especially when young so bit angry yes bit revenge annoying thoughts  should go away usefulless and no interesst in them anyway. COme from feeling verarscht and misused in EXTREME unheared ways but its jhust a contingency and would nto help and not interessted win-win everything else not worth would be only risk no gain and im not interssted luckely anyway. if true then that is enuight punishment for world anyway. Grateful for good stuff

many many many things to be grateful for even if seems way less than rest and small but all requried to be happy/grateful here no matter how outside world and ja many potentially good and      such

[17.12.2023, 13:17:22] Marco Luca Hefti: I seem to be wasting time, I have no idea what I did, except, I guess, praying and being horny or whatever. It's 13.15, 19.15, and yeah. So, the day feels kind of good, but I'm not getting stuff done, and I need to clean the joint apartment, I need to tidy up, I need to program a thing, and it's not going to happen, it seems, and yeah. Also, would have wanted to go to the church, but ChatGPT doesn't give me the address or when it is. And yeah, my attention issues adhd

[17.12.2023, 18:45:47] Marco Luca Hefti: Dear God thank you very much for guiding steps to church. Italian messe but prayed/shrines/candles/other stuff. Prayed a bunch hope is also fine while i sleep out my illness or am less cpnfused what youd like. Surely there are more important things than just sit in church mindlesly but the problem is that would be my interpretation and other ideas would say no so i did both but ja bit more church if u like and less pain/discomfort would help with the morning prayer whatever Stretch the prist said also i basically am behind a LOT LOT LOT LOT im herr because bought food seems legit to quickly get here without seeming crazy. 

(Bible app prayers please let me do more prayers written in here if u“d like.
Also if u think uts better u can take 1% of my free will threshhold and invest it into making sure i get the basic thibgs like E.F. And other stuff to get basic fundamental thibgs going that then exponentially help with the other goals.

So ja that would be great seems but maybe u got ur reasons to not and i just say „u can“ because maybe u choose to not do it without people wanting that idk…


Amen

[16.01.2024, 19:54:14] Marco Luca Hefti: Two days been tiny bit rejuvinating but not really but only time will tell. Not aure when they happen again feel bit tired just feom two days pray music and some paperwork and still super behind but also solid 5.5/10 and ja work might suck but should be opportunity ans solid after sleep and days but still boring but maybe aome stuff in between no idea what to do

[18.01.2024, 17:47:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Maybe i took 20mg Equasim by mistake because i had no 20mg Equasim i combine to 40g Eauasim and my adhd made me forget and not organice effitiently enought and painfuly be too tired and all to early get the persciption. Well it seems to make not much of a difference if it is only that but i think that might have been why the day might have been a bit more bored and potentially worse after not surei mean it was not too bad
[19.01.2024, 19:01:35] Marco Luca Hefti: I was in a few churches quickly while wating on tram oand from work to steuererklärung fischarkt 10 steuerverwaltung i could not reach them the museumsnacht event ir anything :)
[19.01.2024, 19:06:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Also the tiniest charity and a schutzengel although surely since nothing works that wont do anything but itonic or makng stuf worse or just a charty or smth from work stress isteaction dome piano vhurch loment relax time goe brain slow as always when it is not great or works way better condonstantly gor long.

Anyway shit life. :) solid what is expected there is the shadow of smth interessting among it. But ja boring seems but lets hope there is a afterlife because a lie this bad and unfair surely needs one now it could chane maybe my mood is not good for another reason idk…

Anyway cant remember what to do and to do lists seem like discomfort and pain nhancer and i have lots of discomfort 

Now

[26.01.2024, 09:23:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Called UPK about the perscriptions eventhough Doctors would be already informed. I was informed that the doctors are unavailable for now busy but that ut will be directed to the right path and i when aked said Hirzbrunnen Badischer banhhof like 5 years past all usual continuing and my Psychoatrist of 7 Years Dr Dubach and street Nd that he is also a psychiatrist able to give out medstheoreticaly in case need for consultation arises. It was about Equasim i was asked how much said 40mg twice day like the last months and mentioned importance for work.

Hirzbrunnen said important to get perscriptions still dont have them. (As usual) it seems just normal that they are delayed.
[26.01.2024, 09:29:21] Marco Luca Hefti: r r rUPK said i dont get persciption i should call DR Rohmeder Praxis directly.

I did that and gave all information and hope the perscription will come because it was Telefonbeantworte
[26.01.2024, 09:30:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Telefonbeantworter no natural peraon so i left a electronic message with all the infos and a request to send the persciption for Equasim to the Hirzbrunnen Apotheke Badischer Bahnhof

[26.01.2024, 16:11:55] Marco Luca Hefti: It is very unlickely that some sekt of psychopaths narcissist wants to get me homeless and psychologically sabotaged in brainvelopment as much as possible in order to get me not able to lawuit anyone with standing. But i would say such is quite unluckely and a far reach. However conveniently the context would be so complex and my social standing already to some extent hampered because strong adhd and adhd treatment that seems quite strange in some way. However. Althought a bunch if other factors would corrolate with that basian probabilistic hypothesis i would hope pro corruption free organisations and checks and balances would catch that. Basically i got a vanishingly small confidence 😭

However. I got to work no time to entertain that. ‎<This message was edited>

[28.01.2024, 15:30:50] Marco Luca Hefti: That was a error that it showed that i think
[28.01.2024, 15:34:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Also was mitte at post between markt and barfüsserplatz. And got a bad tasting cheap since i am low on money since im usually exessivelly unlucky especially with lack of woman no matter how i look or how many i ask out. I saw some heavily overweight people holding hands with very hot woman
[28.01.2024, 15:36:32] Marco Luca Hefti: So guess adhd fucks me or maybe im not routhless and narcissistic egoistic and eoman might be only attracted to winning war on any level even cultural and win-win might be somehow not to be cared about. But i think God just hates me.
[28.01.2024, 15:47:39] Marco Luca Hefti: Oh and the mario tosin shaked my hand and asked how i am. After the gottesdienst a goo d man seems. Vicotor magnenat said he is a friend of his once i believe. Some angry thoughts because lack of bj /69 /woman i feel taunted. But whatever now praying rosarys. I seem to have endless patience i hope there is no thought crime because thete are some impulsive reven g thoughts ultra rarely but they are not nice. However it is like the thought of eating vomit you would not and u font like it and the thought comes and goes like a bad spirit. Yes win-win endless opportunitys missed 1-30 no sexuality you never get back if there is no heaven, infinite life with age reversal, near perfect simulation, extreme spiritual/psychological joy baselinestates zb or reincarnation.

That makes me quite angry but it seems like i cant be angry for long but ja. Maybe because i have been do consistanty and massively moral now my body as a reversal or consequence wants to do the opposite which eould be the opposite of the best possible stuff maybe i dont know how spiritual psychological stuff worcs. i cant even ask someoe out such massive discomfort against it. I stopped wearing the garmin since my life is shit with it. 15:47 now
[28.01.2024, 17:41:17] Marco Luca Hefti: I pray for your herrlichen namen in jesus christs name. When the app crsh e and my careful undually good message was deleted and i now cant tememver and no motivation to write a good one again. Sabotage app crashed all lost. I have ben extreamly unlucky and am single. Bought a rosary chain with roses and or lilys to pray the 54 day novena i know who i fancy but i have little to no expectations. I just pray for continued guidance. And to love pain and praising you instead of continually staying single despite desperately wanting a r woman and lots of win-win situations unused almost tauntingly. Becoming bitter and resentful would be boring. Valentines day i seem single lots of people even very overweight people seem to have very hot gf. Guess my shyness and discomfort and lack of smoothness and mental health afflictions make it hard. Every time I make a good message, it gets deleted for some technical reason or whatever. It's like sabotage. And then I don't have the energy or the motivation to write it again. Anyway, I wrote that I prayed for the five people that will do Taufe next Sunday. In the Clara Church I was asked, I pray for the people that will go, the Jugendliche that will go to Erstkommunion and Firmament later too. And also for Maria Thosen because I kind of seems to be an out-and-about person that knows me and so on. And yeah, I forgot the rest, but I wrote a really long, really good thing in the Hello app and then the Hello app crashed. It never does that. Only then did everything was deleted. Anyway in jesus chists name please do not let it go on since 1-30 years where brutal and devoid of andy physical intimacy overall terrible while others whete arrogantly swimming in ladys treating them like food they cant swallow since they have such overflow of luck and divine grace and blessings. Oh and lots of bad feelings like in psalm 69 i just prayed seems to also be going on so i may have worse problems. Extreamly discomfort dystimia depressive life and i pray to have patience with thoughts of anger because of perceived injustice because of that. Grateful for cold showers, gym and pain of hard wood church banks praying endurance. I forgot my phone and gym bag at home today since i wanted to be in time for sunday gottesdinst eucharistie at St Clara church. 10-11:30 also elisabeth and st . Joseph church. I was also at a other church but it was closed. I pray for guidance. Also i was theatre, tingueli fountain, mitte at barfi/marktplatz and some fountains and januskopf basel schweiz marco luca hefti 5.11.1993
Pray mario tosin, 5 people getauft next sunday, erstcommunion and firmung jugendlich, the people that hate me for unknown reasons and Adelina Darakus mental health challenge mother. My family. Everyone nature animals even bad dictators since noone just before you and u can fill the gaps in there heart and understanding and i like Adelina Daraku, i hope to get less of a child adhd that holds me back from her and woman in generall being spiritually turned off by me and my shyness and low energy and brain not working making organisation and doing even the boring and simple hard. Thank you God. In jesus christs name i desperately ask you this and thank for not letting this go on. Amen.

Also gona work a tiny bit longer just in case since im alwats falsely accused with bad biased intentions usually. And if not ill admit instantly and know before hand and usuly the things causing it are in the hands of the ignorant… abyway.

All my fault ;)
[31.01.2024, 11:55:20] Marco Luca Hefti: Barely a free second and even if then it would be not remembering what i tryed to do since all workingmemory focused on tasks whenever there is a breathing space it smgets stuffed to keep me at limit of never being selfsufitient by bad luck. Adhd and whTever too complex who cares

Betreff: Update und Handyprobleme

Hallo Papa,

ich wollte dir ein kurzes Update geben. Zu den Steuern: Ich habe die 2. Mahnung erhalten, aber keine Sorge, ich habe bereits reagiert – per E-Mail, Anruf und persönlich. Die Steuern für 2022 wurden bis Ende 2024 verlängert. Der Mahnbrief und meine Reaktion haben sich wohl überschnitten.

Zum Alltag: Ich bin beschäftigt mit Arbeit, Essen, Schlafen, Sport und Rechnungen. Auch spirituelle Aktivitäten wie Meditation nehmen viel Zeit in Anspruch, besonders wegen meines ADHD.

Stimmung: Stabil, aber etwas langweilig. Milde bis moderate Beschwerden, wie üblich, aber insgesamt besser als früher. Eine solide 5/10.

Zum Handy: Es geht auch kaputt, wahrscheinlich ein Displayproblem. Wenn du ein Ersatzhandy hättest, wäre das toll. Es würde mir Geld und Zeit sparen. Ansonsten werde ich bald ein neues kaufen.

Liebe Grüße,
Marco-Luca Hefti

Originale version:

2. Mahnung und „keine Reaktion“ trotz massiver Reaktion von mir über mail, Anruf, persöhnlich und Bestätigung das 2022 steuern bis ende 2024 verlängert worden sind. Vermutlich Brief nur überschnitten. 

Alltag:
Ich arbeite, esse schlafe, sport, Rechnungen und Reaktion von mir über mail, Anruf, persöhnlich und Bestätigung das 2022 steuern bis ende 2024 verlängert worden sind. Vermutlich brief nur überschnitten. 

Alltag:
Ich arbeite, esse schlafe, sport, Rechnungen und spirituelles wie meditation/entspanung un ähnliches nehmen alle Zeit in Anspruch auch keine Energie speziell wegen ADHD scheint.

Mood:
Aber stabil langweilig, milde manchmal moderate Misempfindungen wie üblich ausser in gewissen monsten/jahren seit kind. Besser als sonst und dankbar. Solide 5/10.

Nur als kleines update.

2. Handy geht such kaputt . Schwer eine Nachricht zu schreiben glaube display problem.

Wenn du nich ein Handy hättest wäre ich dankbar und wir könnten Geld und ich einige Stunden Zeit sparen. Ansonsten gehe ich bald mal eines kaufen.

[02.02.2024, 13:54:37] Marco Luca Hefti: I was fired
[02.02.2024, 13:58:37] Marco Luca Hefti: Suprided a bit eventhough i expect stuff like this based on past life. Still it seems  still kinda edge stuff.

But ja als kinds joke calls taubtibg like „Jack the reaper and other stuff well. Dont think law is s think think corruption could be a thing even if that contingency (wont go into it) is true.

I am not sayingi was fired out of cpt. or planed nacissist games.

All is normal and great. Ill go back to RAV i guess. No choice.
[02.02.2024, 14:03:00] Marco Luca Hefti: There is no way though it was very legit. People day crazy things up there and none of them get fired. :)

Man i was grateul for work but i already prepared for bs i was also fired exCtly in the 30 minutes my adhd medication was not active.

So a coincidence right the second i took out my medication like each day after 8 hours is a seeming down turn of it and then it kicks in. 

Aynyway not so trusting in organisations here but who knows. Now i have time for the taxes although i have to wait for the returns anyway ill guess i go to Steuerverwaltung
[02.02.2024, 14:32:52] Marco Luca Hefti: Steuerverwaltung
RAV
Notifying people as is usual and seems good
Gym
Trying to stay grateful and positive which this promts since
Keep praying
Keep doing more of the useful and yet do less of the not useful although much of those so ethinem *seem* in the realm of spirituality/psychology/biology usually it is better to believe Things are changable since usually they are/positive stuff pays despite. So with strong adhd and seemingly some complex things that seem a bit like well … no time might seem crazy otherwise. Context

Allright ‎<This message was edited>
[02.02.2024, 14:44:06] Marco Luca Hefti: Grateful people and eventhough i felt bad it was more a ramped up not so much bad only or definitlifely guess it matters where to channel the alertness.

It is not overly strong as i am quite stable maybe more than other people or a bit numb from experience as well „gefasst“ maybe to use the more positive side of the medal. ‎<This message was edited>

Thank you Selah. Thank you.Nomine, Domini , Behemoth, benedictus, jesus christ. (Not sure how and what names,  so i just put some names from the church songs). Thank you for singing.

In jesus christs and the holy dpirit and the vaters name Amen

I am almost forced to do exeptional automation, outsourcing snd hyper genious level organisation some day since otherwise it seems hardly possible in a correct dubmissive way to life a normal life upholding responsibility’s. I am mega bored as well. But community, bzw a lot of faith are foundatiional pillers seemingly.

[11.02.2024, 15:20:53] Marco Luca Hefti: Your experience with hanging in an iron cross after a hard workout might give you a small glimpse of the immense suffering that Jesus went through during the crucifixion. It's a sobering reminder of the immense sacrifice that was made for us, and it can be a powerful way to connect with the story of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection on a more personal level. 

 Good message

Not a cross from ho more habging but to be fair that might not be all to much les than the iron then again idk got to do gymnastics maybe

[14.02.2024, 15:16:13] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad helps a lot with bills right now ~5-20 also bit tidy. Never ending task but meha help

[14.02.2024, 16:08:02] Marco Luca Hefti: Dad / Vater left appartment great help but my brain was slow to remember what i was working on especially when he gave me multible things to do.

Relatively simple things mostly while i was filling out form. All normal just intuition of time could be  better as usual with adhd.

Brain despite breakfast + 1 more quick meal in between slow to remember workingmwmory. Often longer times until irbered what i was doing when distracted.

Just like normal just only able to focus on 1 thing anything else has to be written down.

Feels unlucky. Could do much if brain was as it somethimes easily can be often corrolatibg with medication/coffee/usw

Also sleep was very short despite early bed.
[14.02.2024, 16:10:31] Marco Luca Hefti: 40 EQ just kicked in. No break until 10 min when dad left despite low cognitive load. Feels like brain does all with 10% and despite 90% free and fresh imeasily exhausted. Brainengagemwnt paperwork low.

Now significant discomfort dad = present.

Was plesant.

Now tidy up dad had to leave quick bussiness related
[14.02.2024, 16:12:26] Marco Luca Hefti: Soon birthday no time since occupiers dad dont feel in position ondecline and i am grateful.

Little time since slow.

Finishing up then shower and prepare pickup 18:15

Jogging and looking at fasnchts stuff
Machine lerning for dummys book in gym eventhought organisation much more important more about motivation or idk productivity enhancing whatever. Cold shower in the morning after gym forgot dance schoes but no Yoga and no dancing today i mistook the plan because fasnacht no yoga and gym but okd plan was out. Also forgot some other things i would crave a cesar salad in the 3 kings restaurant but im sure it is too expensive so i will go mcdonalds or smth i would make it myself but mcdonalds cesar salad is cheaper and less opportunitycost than buying raw chickenbreast alone they are not even freerange chickenbreasts i apprechate chicken breasts they are tight.

Now i will go jogging since it is opportunity to be stuffed with confetti , good for focus and mind or just to earn the cesar salad. Also maybe i see rein holdo the homeless and i could check on the M. community

[07.03.2024, 15:29:21] Marco Luca Hefti: Migros bank 13 minutes in the Warteschlange the system says "maximal time in waiting might soon be exeeded the call will then be ended"
[07.03.2024, 15:57:27] Marco Luca Hefti: 25 minutes service line bank so far Warteschlange and my simple question is how do i see positive money
[07.03.2024, 16:10:29] Marco Luca Hefti: Person cant tell me if u can see only the "Zahlungseingänge" the "green numbers" where money comes *in* instead of *out*.  She said "Moment schnell" Frau Koch Ester and now i am in the warteschlage sind 2-3 minutes and i got a feeling she does not come back. She seemed to become angry as well for this simple question after she was unable to know and seemed to struggle greatly she seemed to see the software for the first time and talked about how i can search by "name" repetedly while i where repeating the question extreamly patiently that i was asking if she knew if it is possible to see only the money that came IN.

Seems like a ultra simple question. I am happy she did not lye and just say no without knowing so i apprechate her. Now it seems to me that those people have 0 clue what they are doing and this is the most basic thing i could have asked. BUT i do not wish to judge since it might be subjective.

Anyway it is now 5 minutes since she said "kurze moment bitte" and "i never seen her again" seems to become more and more likely.
[07.03.2024, 16:12:35] Marco Luca Hefti: It baffles me. I when i work at phone company am expected to have things in seconds. Almost seems like some people start to behave like careless when they hear my voice strange. I mean would you not fear to be fired if you did that to customers? 41 min in the hotline
[07.03.2024, 16:14:00] Marco Luca Hefti: Probably just a reality show: "Destroy this persons life in the secretly autoritarian state X" Or a "Lets fuck over people for funny jokes" or smth.

or just baaaaaaaad luck.
[07.03.2024, 16:22:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Phone finished.
[07.03.2024, 16:22:43] Marco Luca Hefti: I mean she is sympatic and a nice person problaby.
[07.03.2024, 16:28:23] Marco Luca Hefti: They all are. But the company shuold maybe think of the option to add a "verbinen to the Ebanking line" and she said now i talked to her it wont go to them but probably be redirected to her. So that seems like bad luck that that system is incapable to connect me to the right place after having talked to a person. 

So i think other people would say that is the most incompetent laughable stuff from movies but i personally.... who knows maybe God personally made it this way to  mess with people which would be perfectly fine just... idk. Anyway who cares 1 hour later and massive ammounts of patience. It is extra awesome when they sound vorwurfsvoll and scolding after as well. Which i might be crazy but it sounded a bit like this. Those people seem like they are at the edge of there sanity and anything can make them lose there mind. And answering any question is redirected to a question you did not ask. 

Well. Anyway. Who knows would have to crossreference that with other people. Those people find work i dont no idea why i would think in terms of effitiency and givng out information i could have handles that a magnitude better but then again they might be great at BackOffice work or smth. I dont talk about her in genreal. Other people would have gona completely insane however not sure how they handle that maybe they just hang up.
[07.03.2024, 16:30:41] Marco Luca Hefti: Anyway therapeutic log writing aftert that one finished. I need more therapy after this wating in Warteschlange thing but hey we had a nice phonecall if timepressure was not a think and i was a milionaire. I liked her emotional thing man so good at staying professional it seems insane.
[07.03.2024, 16:33:24] Marco Luca Hefti: I have to load the guilt on me and selfdepricate that those people dont start to cry it seems. And emotionally support them every time i fucking call for some form or anything. It is not limited to the bank. Somethimes they are totally chill and do or say the correct info in 1 minute and i isntantly move on. I think im just fearful of the homeless life since i did charity work with them. Sounds horrible. And then you would get this kind of help? God have mercy on you u because you would need it. Jesus Christ - help

[11.03.2024, 22:42:29] Marco Luca Hefti: If there is a good he seems to randomly torture some people and reward carelessness or punish being honest and win-win almost like a narcissist divides people really sad.

25 Strattera und ~35mg Equasim 

eine gute Dosis zu sein.

Vor DFZ Arbeit vom: ~ Dezember 2023 bis März 2024 

30 Strattera + 40 Equasim

Dann 18 Strattera und 40 Equasim seit einigen Monaten und jetzt eine Art burnout aber besser mit Koffein oder post coffein was eventuell das tiefere Strattera etwas ausgleichen könnte.

[15.03.2024, 15:20:58] Marco Luca Hefti: I am going homeless almost like people do it on purpose the timing when dad gave me the extra stuff is also unlucky seems like it should look natural so i lose my autonomy
[15.03.2024, 15:21:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Message Dad: "Übervordert mental health. Bräuchte hilfe bei Paperwork. Weiss nicht an wehn wenden. Psychiater und UPK schieben nur rum und haben bis jetzt keine Ressourcen benannt wie ein Sozialarbeiter der kurzfristig bis zum Termin bei Papierkram wie Rechnungen und Administrativen etwas aushelfen kann."
[15.03.2024, 16:53:53] Marco Luca Hefti: continual water sipping every 30 min minimum see barely difference hydration food seems to not be much affected. Periods of low appetite and dry mougth as with stimulatns corrlating when they work not really observed since long 

less exhausted since nature walk trying my best
[15.03.2024, 17:05:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Coffein strange on the one hand i seem to write more easily currently but somethimes overstimulated so maybe the dosage is the issue  given it is 5 and i stopped Coffein about 1 for sleep even before reduced given halvlife maybe 50% of what i took today so maybe around 650 + 3 greentea so maybe around mg 350mg tomorrow which is 50% less that would be 150 upon waking up and every 3 hours 100mg which would be small coffee.

[18.03.2024, 18:47:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Told psychiatrist on oy a tiny but help from a social worker would b enouggt dont need it now but maybe later but psychiatrist and dad seem to be a bit idk.

Annoying
[18.03.2024, 18:47:44] Marco Luca Hefti: Im totaly normal and not crazy.
[18.03.2024, 18:49:32] Marco Luca Hefti: Coding and sideprojects would be way more fun but in forced to do paperwork ultra ineffitiently.
[18.03.2024, 18:49:34] Marco Luca Hefti: It seems
[18.03.2024, 19:05:48] Marco Luca Hefti: This might sound weird when taken out of context of a historical phislosophical quick discussion imreally not overly religious i just do thing ibtensely adhd hyperfocus somethimes withiut the right meds im kinda locked in/forced into some things:

By the way, there was like this nuance that maybe said they kind of like pray kind of in a negative way where they pray something bad is going to happen to someone or for example they know someone hates being tortured and hates having a quiet life and then they pray that they get spiritual enlightenment by being extra quiet or having a very torturous life to kind of find the great strength of quietness or something but in in effect they just try to torture someone on purpose of course it's not really that they want that or maybe they do it but someone kind of leads them to it so yeah it's kind of the machine learning thing anyway that's just one if god were real that that would be actually something to be concerned about but anyway i'm just a quick note and then we go back to the normal thing that the usual normal people believe

That is another thing adhd medication could be misused for

[18.03.2024, 20:12:04] Marco Luca Hefti: Stiving for balance. Gym next and some break reduced prayer potentially a little bit.

Recent weeks the concentration dropped a bit applicaiton RAV where a bit hard and Dad came and i instantly had that effect of someone being with u and its easyer. Also the money is a bit longer and i am not sure if i should reduce the prayer stuff.

Over all im just checking in quickly to various AI models to kinda tell me storry in some ways some of the time somethimes hyperfocus ADHD intense other times not so much
[18.03.2024, 21:36:30] Marco Luca Hefti: When dad was here and had me made signature on his laptop idk about it how i can do it on my pc that is what he said i shoudl do it with every Bewerbungsschreiben i send or smth. 

I did it before but ja. Today hoped to put up the Drucker as well. The discomfort just keeps me slow procrastinating to escape it. Somethimes it is totally gone for a year but somethimes (corrolating with ADHD meds mainyl and dystimia mayba  bit) it is bad.

2) Grateful for small success and keep tring to gain the minimal EF that is definitly possible become super supe capable and do kind stuff like saving narcissists in prison and or being humble and quiet in a corder doing some hidden good stuff that is kinda Art but maybe just the usual just trying to not think of scary stuff. Or other romantic stuff like AI right and some other things and bussiness stuff or homeless upstart stuff or whatever exept if the homeless are  Art and more or les grateful then how about meaning and adventure for depressed rich dudes and overweight middleaged woman or elderly or anyone or whatever. Or none of those or so balanced it wont upset much or invest it all and do cool stuff and praying or becoming a atheist because scared or prayer or spiritual telgious atheist weird flamboyance


3) Or dping rsndom stuff eitj money and energx öike guitarr öedsions priono lessiond honeöess dude spontisnuity, neural networ (favorite) plaxibg ganes data analysis in some regards but not like i have to depends ig im lesd dcsred might not need or idk

4) visit grandpsrents

5) i kinda like the spiritual dtuff but i feal dcared to be unlucky and go broke because i go into the dpiritual mindset so blance it more and feel less like a chore or smth and more only when i enjoy or when idk

5) be confused and scared which seems boring and random kinda like coinflipping
[18.03.2024, 22:44:44] Marco Luca Hefti: 6) i mean . Just options

[20.03.2024, 10:02:09] Marco Luca Hefti: torture diuscomfort but nothing new
[20.03.2024, 10:37:46] Marco Luca Hefti: called mom told her the situation with responsibilitys and finanzial things and social woeker she offered to come over for paperwork
[20.03.2024, 10:37:59] Marco Luca Hefti: Said the situation with upk and such
[20.03.2024, 12:46:08] Marco Luca Hefti: passionsfrucht was 1 frank for 3 so that was extreamly cheap normally i dont buy because too expensive
[20.03.2024, 13:25:00] Marco Luca Hefti: brain_lagg_as_so_often_recently_slower_than_normal_but_perfectly rational otherwise just like i was as old as my Grandmother or something
[20.03.2024, 14:20:31] Marco Luca Hefti: Der Sekundenzeiger rennt über die Uhr
[20.03.2024, 14:22:09] Marco Luca Hefti: its like it is 2x as fast or smth or 3x i remember when it slowed down to almsot still that year and it was so beautiful to play wow eventhough the other parsts of Brian wher estill often not really so good it was really fun. Could do a wow armor of * kinda game that would be really fun kinda like a t course but with wow just need a bunch of s i
[20.03.2024, 14:22:17] Marco Luca Hefti: Used some shortforms there.
[20.03.2024, 14:22:39] Marco Luca Hefti: so brain sluggish at remembering what to do but normal speed at rmemebering what to write in some regards here.
[20.03.2024, 14:22:45] Marco Luca Hefti: selective recall speed seems
[20.03.2024, 14:23:13] Marco Luca Hefti: And it could be much much much faster as is normal for many and nothing i ever did in terms of recall was not exceeded by many humans
[20.03.2024, 14:24:41] Marco Luca Hefti: The only thing that might be a bit unique is the cretivity in philosophy and ideas what to do but that is obbvious if you have nothign else to do. Talk to smart peeps and most of all millions of hours of being forced to not have fun and to instead learn stuff and i dont know it is modern time and i have high goals because my life seems to be in need of massively high goals if it was more fun i could reduce them a bit or lots im very flexible.
[20.03.2024, 14:25:11] Marco Luca Hefti: Back to pomodoros where i seem to make 0 progress no idea how that is possible strange almsot like timed negative serendipity
[20.03.2024, 14:26:04] Marco Luca Hefti: My brain seems mysteriously blocked in some regards and it totally can which the periods show where it is unblocked it is selective and ADHD x10 and personalized seems
[20.03.2024, 14:27:36] Marco Luca Hefti: And it compounds so if i get 10% worse at 2 Brian parts then it is not = 20% worse it is 30% becuase the tasks go longer new problems and new challenges arrise and such. And at some point ur so slow hypothetically that u make 0.1% progress and eventually 0% like a LLM that contantly forgets and does work it already did or forgets the progress it made
[20.03.2024, 15:35:59] Marco Luca Hefti: no idea where time went i  could say rationally easily it is all super logical but i forget so quick and no time to spend 5 minutes remembering what i did. The working memory like remembering what i did is very very very not good.
[20.03.2024, 15:36:16] Marco Luca Hefti: seems*
[20.03.2024, 15:41:28] Marco Luca Hefti: cheked copy quick website

quickly saving email i feel like time rockets nothing new im super rational just like 70 years old probably wrong ADHD meds or smth with delayed effect
[20.03.2024, 15:44:26] Marco Luca Hefti: stress anflutend or idk i dont really feel stressed exept from the situation but sluggish like crazy liek the opposite of what i would guess speed would feel like or Ritalin or elvanse when you take it and you get fast or strattera i know that you can get faster althought that was rare usually it is hard to detect until you look at the watch and you did lots and the time is myseriously only 1-2 hours passed then you notice the second Zeiger slower well anyway the second zeiger is running it is like "shit my life im dying as we speak pls go slower" but other than that im toally normal exept my brain uuuuuuuuultra slugish but very subtle i dont feel especially unstable at all just ultra slow and bad brain recall speed
[20.03.2024, 15:45:14] Marco Luca Hefti: mega slow recall speed it seems for most stuff that is more working memory related or when im bored as if dopamine drains there when it is already low baseline becuas of the state. The opposite of "wow im fresh and my mind is quick and good"
[21.03.2024, 09:12:43] Marco Luca Hefti: unsure what to do time passes decition paralisis a bit
[21.03.2024, 09:22:05] Marco Luca Hefti: brain sluggish breath supressed brain like i did not eat enought but i did.
[21.03.2024, 10:58:58] Marco Luca Hefti: Shets wash way overdue
[21.03.2024, 10:59:05] Marco Luca Hefti: pry on side
[21.03.2024, 11:07:06] Marco Luca Hefti: prying the rosary a bit since mind seems to not really go much anyway then pomodoros maybe 20 5 isntead 

super slow but i got to do the RAV stuff first maybe i can do it and i do not really trust medical stuff to solve my problems or  lets say the institutions to be reliant always or fast in the end u go down in burocracy and fall through the cracks or smth
[21.03.2024, 11:07:36] Marco Luca Hefti: so selfhelp balanced with getting help as i did and continue to do community and family and basically everything

[22.03.2024, 17:38:22] Marco Luca Hefti: es fällt mir derzeit schwer, normal zu funktionieren. Da ich natürlich nicht obdachlos werden möchte habe ich, besonders in den letzten Monaten, mehrmals versucht, mit der UPK und Ihnen Kontakt aufzunehmen. Meine primäre Sorge gilt meiner finanziellen Situation in naher Zukunft.

Wie oft periodisch üblich leide ich unter Misempfindungen was wie immer zunächst nebensächlich ist. 

Zuletzt stark verstärkt habe ich sehr langsame Denkprozesse. Das Arbeiten dauert so lange, dass ich kaum meinen ohnehin schon stark reduzierten Pflichten nachkommen kann. Aktuell nehme ich ohne Unterbrechung seit dem 30.11.2023 wieder folgende Medikation: 18 mg Atomoxetin einmal pro Tag (7:30 Uhr morgens) und 40 mg Equasym zweimal pro Tag (7:30 und 15:30 Uhr).

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,

Marco Luca Hefti

Also brain kinda still not so good in gym shower hard to think of grateful stuff. Also discomfort in gym and body did not really breath as much as it should have given the contraints kinda like it would be low drive to breath despite commands and rather have the downsides. However feeling less discomfort after gym however kinda aktually not sure maybe the same. Brain feels kinda sluggish like when you have a blackout just permanent and mild and somethimes not present and works better. seems quite boring and imparing and makes it hard to do chores and pflichten and therefore 0 time for freetime ever until i will die i will not have been able to do the most basic stuff to ever have time for anything else it seems.

[31.03.2024, 19:56:31] Marco Luca Hefti: I've discussed the situation with concentration and the kind of UPK and so on, and psychiatry. That said, we have to do something. A rough might not be the right thing, and psychiatrists don't really react, so we have to do something maybe with EVA or with someplace where the different kind of ADHD working memory, which seems to be quite impairing right now, is kind of like DELT4 or something, and we kind of discussed it. Now it was Easter, and now we're still here on Easter, so I said I have to go quick, but it seems to be something that is quite impairing, and even if I make a little bit more progress, it seems very small.
[31.03.2024, 20:30:42] Marco Luca Hefti: On he way back its crazy how fast days go over and im bored and dycomfort bit torture as well but im used to that. Time can be much slower

[02.04.2024, 13:58:48] Marco Luca Hefti: Lots of discomfort, will shave, then go buy jogging pants because my one jogging thing is not enough because I need to wash it constantly and I only have one and the other one broke because the thing we were retired the knot was too I kind of couldn't open the knot anymore so it was kind of like not able to be used as a jogging pants anymore I guess it's also because of ADHD and because my brain concentration is just very low and it's like you have discomfort and everything and everything becomes a chore even doing things the right way and like putting a lot of effort into stuff and when you do low effort stuff like that happens and if you put a lot of effort then you and you want to avoid discomfort then you're slow but then you don't have time so now shaving and then going because I don't don't make progress with applications anyway because the discomfort is really really hard to to like concentrate but I'm also not sure because I forget all the time so I don't know how effective my pomodoro sessions are when I actually just stick with it because I forget really really quickly some things other things my memory is perfect my memory is really good with like other stuff but with when I'm trying to work and like remember what to do to apply to a job I just keep forgetting all this stuff as if it's really quickly like as if it's a dream when you have a dream you forget it really quickly it's kind of like that just of course less extreme but and it also varies and so on so I guess I would just go do this because it's also uncomfortable to go and buy this jogging thing and to shave and it's going to be painful to shave but I have to do it and because I'm quite poor I can't always change like the blades and I already forgot how old this blade is anyway and buying blades takes so long and have no time I really have to apply and I'm out of money so or I'm low on money and behind stuff so I guess I'm a little bit stressed maybe that caused also discomfort or maybe because I was yesterday in the gym and I mean I ate my my appetite is like very low but I ate like stuff even just recently I make sure to drink regularly and eat regularly and the sleep I would have done as well but I was just not tired even though I avoided coffee and after like one or two o'clock I didn't take any coffee and before that it was very moderate like below 200 300 milligrams

[07.04.2024, 20:55:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Recently, my roommate said how I am, and I didn't feel too good. The day was especially bad, and I kind of said, well... I was kind of hesitating, and I was like, whatever. I said just, yeah, kind of shit, or whatever. And then I kind of, haha, blah, blah, positive. Not really saying much. And the next day, he said, well, nice weather. I said, yeah, yeah, it's nice. Nice sunshine, this is good, this. And then he said, yeah, he goes to holiday, blah, blah. I said, oh, nice. Did you try last minute, and ordering far in advance for cheap, blah, blah, blah. And now he kind of did the trash. It was overflowing from the bathroom and the normal trash in the kitchen. And he was kind of sitting there, and the trash was outside. I guess he was kind of waiting to see if I take it down or something. He seemed a little bit more quiet. But it could be. It's just normal. If people suspect you're depressed, they kind of test you. The first thing or instinct is, I'm not going to do anything for you. I'm not going to do 1% more. I'm going to actually test you if you do exactly, perfectly 50%, at least. That seems to be the kind of vibe. So that's always the vibe. That's why you never say you're bad off. People think then you get kind of like supportive thing, but it's the opposite. Any time, even just the slightest hint and blood is in the air, then people either think about moving out or seeing if they can kind of take advantage of you while you're down or something. That's the vibe. I'm not saying they do that. I think just a few people do that. And it's just kind of self-preservation, I guess, even if they're very well off. Anyway, who cares. They brought the trash down. And it's very nice that he changed the trash and the other thing in the bathroom. That's awesome. I told a few people to kind of leave the bathroom door open. They usually forget because I said because of the moisture and so on. But anyway, it's great. I'm really, really grateful that people don't. Yeah, that's awesome that I found those. That's very nice. Awesome. Grateful for that.

I have to do a lot of administrative work with the kind of ordering things and doing this calculating things so it's way more work anyway anyway so yeah I'm back I have the salad from the kind of singing whatever thing I was even there late it's crazy it's like I'm pretty low energy at this timing so it's a wonder I went out but sometimes the discomfort goes away instantly with some certain things and sometimes it's very much if I do something so it seems to not be real it just seems to be very specific for example let's say I read book a then I get a lot of discomfort and then I read book b I have basically no discomfort or very little although the book piece are very rare and very specific usually um at least they exist so I'm just saying that uh just yeah for protocol stuff dressed nicely got a caesar salad sauce from mcdonald's got some 50% reduced things I'm also very true for that's good I would say thanks

[10.04.2024, 11:28:40] Marco Luca Hefti: I will hopefully not have nothing done almost again time goes too quick

 Whenever I will try to do something useful, then I will have discomfort until I'm stopping. So, I have no choice than to wait for a psychiatrist. I don't know. I don't know. I also don't sleep well, so maybe that's that. Just, time goes way too fast to do anything. Sometimes, brain is good, but it's totally out of my control, it seems. It seems to be... I don't know. Yeah. That said something, but so far nothing. I don't know. Anyway.

[10.04.2024, 15:09:36] Marco Luca Hefti: Alright, it was Motorfahrzeugkontrolle.de, kind of had the chassis number or whatever. Kind of had me sign something, no time to read. You should not sign things that you didn't read. Well, you should not be mentally unhealthy and be dependent on your dad as well. And you should get support from the government when it's needed. And a lot of things should work. Public transport should work in this city in the next three months. It should have worked and the apps should work. The stuff should arrive on time. Your doctors should do their job. Stuff and everything, I guess, everything is great, right? So, thanks to that, grateful for that. So, he kind of takes like ownership or whatever to kind of like sell it or help with that. Otherwise, people might say like, what are you doing with this machine or whatever. So, really awesome of him. Thanks to dad. Thanks to dad. Thanks, thanks, thanks. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Smooth as always. Not all too good traffic, actually. Anyway.

On each side. Anyway, so, it's not embarrassing, I don't give a shit. It's just weird. Anyway, so I was ordering this creatine, right? I never used it, usually. And then I used it, right? Very sparingly. And then I ordered two ones, they never came. It's usually, I buy something, and then it's gone. It's out of stock, never comes back. Then I find it, I order it, and then it just doesn't arrive. I never hear from it again. Never. It's weird. Maybe that's the thing. I don't think it's creatine, I think it's more ADHD or something. But, could be.

Dear OpenAI Support Team,
Thanks. Sure here more updated information regarding the Card Declined Issue Despite Bank Confirmation
I hope this finds you well. Following our previous communications, I have verified with my Visa card issuer that my card is fully operational with no restrictions. Despite this, I am still encountering the "Your card has been declined" error when trying to update my payment method.
Card Verification: I have confirmed with the issuing bank, and they have reassured me that the card is active and should be accepted. All billing details have been double-checked for accuracy.
Request for Further Investigation: It appears the problem might be on the processing end. Could you please investigate this further? Perhaps a review of the transaction logs during my payment attempts might reveal some insights.
Thank you for looking into this matter. I appreciate your help in resolving this issue so I can continue to use your services without interruption.
marco.hefti1@gmail.com would be my work email.
Best regards,
Marco Hefti

[12.04.2024, 18:45:51] Marco Luca Hefti: discomfort burns me out no sport no diet no community involvement its purely medication ADHD and stuff psychology spiritual whatever
[12.04.2024, 19:12:02] Marco Luca Hefti: How is it going? So, I'm basically super bored, discomfort and everything, and yeah, it's really boring. And not sure if I should pray, not sure if I should meditate, not sure what I should do. It's 19.10, the day just went by. ChatGPT, you can talk for hours, just doesn't help you with anything. Like, no actual plan, no, don't do this, do that, it's just ADHD, forget everything. When I try to do, kind of like, forums, it's just forums all the way down, it's just boring. It's like discomfort, it's torture, I'm just tortured. I guess I need to totally offload my brain to not do anything. Whenever I do anything with my brain, it seems to be kind of torturing me, so I guess maybe that's why I offload everything to the computer. I can talk to AI things and have them answer, I guess, but yeah, it's really fucking boring. Do you have any tips or something that is not useless? You probably don't, but yeah, it just needs better memory or whatever, and yeah. Maybe your context window increase is slightly helping that, but who knows

No money to fix or let it fix it somethimes is perfectly normal. system is not strained its at 50% memory no idea where cleaned it cc clean, defraged, updated all kinds of stuff it seems random just some stuff to slow me down bad luck i guess
[13.04.2024, 10:00:16] Marco Luca Hefti: I basically gave up on normal life and psychiatry acts like they can take weeks and months no matter if u cant put on your pants. Nothing new guess it makes financial sense for switzerland. Maybe they just forgot or something (not sarcasm)

Grant me the grace of perpetual growth and blessings that multiply and expand in every aspect of my life. Bless my endeavors, that each step I take forwards multiplies opportunities for further good, enriching my life and the lives of others. Infuse my actions with sincerity and purpose, aligning them with the highest good.

Nourish my aspirations with the wisdom to invest in actions that yield kindness, prosperity, and joy, both for myself and for society. As I navigate through my days, let each moment be an investment in the bank of life, accumulating interest in the form of wisdom, understanding, and compassion.

Bless me with the resources to pursue my passions without burden—whether in technology, relationships, or leisure—allowing me to contribute effectively and joyfully to the world. Provide me with health and vitality, shielding me from harm and enabling me to enjoy the fullness of life.

Enhance my abilities to interact with others with empathy and joy, to engage in activities that nurture my spirit and body, like dancing or yoga, and to approach challenges with resilience and creativity. 

As I proceed, let this prayer echo through my actions, turning every potential misstep into a stepping stone for betterment. May this prayer adjust itself to the needs of the moment, ensuring that it remains perpetually optimal, relevant, and filled with Your divine guidance.

Thank you for the boundless opportunities and the ability to recognize and rectify my shortcomings in ways that elevate my spirit and those around me.

Amen. https://hallow.app.link/yBYOuSHBLIb

[14.04.2024, 09:43:49] Marco Luca Hefti: did not sleep long

green tea

dont feel a difference brain always bad anyway

what i need is a external memory like AI thta remembers everything more or less like a blind dog for blind a memory aid for my brain since my brain seems to be partially deactivated or on the lowest working memory setting.

or normal ADHD treatment might be a idea ive been telling everyone since years but no rules or patient protection in place guess people are slaves freely ignorable and can be done with whatever even a cold is treated more urgently and im sure there are laws in place forcing a doctor to check out and treat a cold

[14.04.2024, 13:28:23] Marco Luca Hefti: ![Image](file-service://file-UJScBH9q44WiGiEKzPKGrnYh)Exhausted laying in bed. I think I will not do anything today except being exhausted on the bed and going there. And washing the thing, but right now, I'm too exhausted to wash it, but I should do it right now. I should just wash those things, and nothing else. And the pants, but... There's a chaos, and even searching a pants takes so much effort, because I don't have enough drive to do things that make subsequent actions easier, leading to a degradation in effort, where it's like increasing costs for nothing. It's kind of like if you don't have the energy to make documentation, and then it gets harder, and then it gets harder, and then you have less time, and then in the end you have endless amount of work, and you can't sustain your kind of thing. It's like a falling house, like the house of cards falling apart more and more, even though it's already pretty much destroyed anyway.

[15.04.2024, 09:29:27] Marco Luca Hefti: Discomfort low drive exhaust boredom then i go jogging because idk what to do
[15.04.2024, 11:52:36] Marco Luca Hefti: ![Image](file-service://file-EGRXfo0KdpCke1OU9DmwhfrP)![Image](file-service://file-v90oDIN32Ms9JvPxmCWTs1bJ)Great for me before the quinoa, chicken, caesar salad, or caesar salad sauce salad, and maybe some blueberry with greek yogurt or whatever. I should not run too much to not overdo it, because I tend to just forget it and then just marathon run or something. And I have to make sure my legs are optimal for kind of being able to run at more times when I'm like in discomfort or something. So I read a tiny bit and then I go back and see if my concentration is better if I'm still in discomfort. If I'm still in discomfort, I just go jog again. I mean, at one point I'm gonna be like a marathon sprinter or something, but I have no choice. I will be the most driven, high-octane business dude once my mental health is fixed, because this is like the most insane training. But what can I do? I mean, if I had no discomfort, I would be working or coding and having an awesome life doing lots of stuff. But like this, I just have to have passive optimal influence from all kinds of AI systems that are super smart and positively influence me in ways we haven't even discovered yet. And learn stuff and read stuff and go jogging. And we'll see. Soon there's the mental health kind of appointment. I'd like the 18th or 4th with Frau Romet or UPK. So that would be in a few days. Now it's 14th or 15th actually. So in three days. Tomorrow is 16th, 17th, 18th and that's when it is. I think, is it on Monday? Today is... Oh no, it's Monday. So Tuesday, Wednesday and on Thursday it seems. On Thursday it would be. I appreciate it. If you have anything mysterious, tidbit, out of context thing, quote, high-octane, startup, business, workflow related, biohacking, carb cycling, carb timing, any kind of micronutrients timing, any kind of Bayesian probabilistic biohacking timing that is worth trying or kind of seeing, whatever. But it's also opportunity, cost and time, right? That's important. So now I'm going to read. How much pages would you say I should read from the Alchemist now on page 143 or something?

[15.04.2024, 12:04:45] Marco Luca Hefti: So, Dad called and he said, if someone from IFAO calls me, I have to pick up, or to tell him, and so on, and invalidates insurance, things, whatever. So, that's awesome, I thank him a lot, thanks, thanks, thanks. That's, yeah, it's a bit, it sucks a bit, but, I mean, I mean, then I can't do much, otherwise now I'm just like constantly like, oh my god, worry, worry, worry, and then I'm doing even less. And, yeah, now I was jogging because I had discomfort and concentration issues and like breathing things. But other than that, like, I'm really, it changes really quickly, like, it could, it's all psychological, I'm pretty sure, it's like, there's also some unfortunate things with the, you know, with the mental health kind of thing. They had to go very quickly, abruptly, and so I'm maybe on this or that medication dose, and so on. So, yeah, sometimes it's really, really good, but sometimes it's not, it's like this mysterious, like, lack of drive. It could be many things, of course, and, of course, if I had like all these things that I could do, for example, data analysis, or kind of this daily structure where I perfectly do exactly the right things, then I could reach insane amounts of productivity, even just with this, I'm pretty sure. Like, even without changing anything, medication or otherwise, I think I could do a lot. Also, like the pray thing also helps with kind of like, you know, meditation, pray, jogging, sport, perfect nutrition, and then perfect organization and everything. And just building up, like, gradually, step by step, without overdoing it, and then keeping those steps secure, documenting everything perfectly, everything perfectly organized, everything, you know, perfectly organized, perfectly timed, all contingency plans for whatever happens. And then that would probably have insane potential, but the thing is, the less productivity you have, then your stuff falls apart, because usually it doesn't last forever, but it's just like a temporary thing. For example, let's say you have like this routine where you wake up and do stretching or something, you have to keep that in mind. And if you one time forget it, then you have to kind of rediscover all the right routine, and maybe you have optimized it and then forget everything. So, this is kind of like this thing, and then because you don't have the routine anymore, then you get even less productive, and then you maybe have not so hunger, or you have stomach pain because you made a mistake, and then you don't eat, and then you sleep worse, and then you miss your routine again, and then you forget it, and then you have to rediscover it, and then you miss the paperwork, and then you have to pay extra money, and then more paperwork, and missed out taxes and so on, and then the social services have to be reduced, and then there's even like less optimal help with this kind of thing, and then you last longer with it, and then you miss opportunities. It's all like this cycle that goes downward and upward, so it could become really good really quick, or just, yeah, that's kind of the thing. So, it's kind of like, it reminds me from the Bible thing, to those who have much more will be given, and to those that have little, the little that they have will be taken from them or something. I guess, luckily, I have a lot in terms of also like the social structure and all the kind of society and everything, so I have like insane amounts, but locally, temporarily, mentally, isolated, I would have little, and then it's kind of like this temporary downwards thing, right? So, that's just like the protocol I'm doing, and now just a quick read to train my brain, so those reading parts, like reading a lot, even though it's more efficient to listen to it very quickly with like high x-speed, which I'm usually doing, I'm still doing that. Even though it's old-fashioned, just to have those epigenetics like activated and a little bit stimulated in my brains and so on, anyway, whatever. Yeah, literature, it's also like a book that is kind of common and whatever, yeah. So, I appreciate that thing, and that's just an e-file, invalidity, insurance, whatever, with rough, Arbeitsvermittlungszentrum and whatever, so I can kind of, and then the mental health thing, so I can apply for job or do what I should really be doing, which is like a startup with kind of like artificial intelligence. So, it's just a normal daily routine where I just make enough money to kind of get to that point where I don't have to worry about that, and then I can fully concentrate on all those kinds of things, and the most important things, which might be mental health, which might be like meditation, this other thing, or kind of like those systems that allow you to do more. It's just like reading. Once you can read, you can do more in less time, and then you have more time to do stuff. And if you're always like, if everyone says, don't learn to read, do it right away, do it right away, that is also good. I'm also a doer. I like to do stuff, but sometimes you have to do efficient things, and you can't put the cart before the horse sometimes. Sometimes you just have to do the most optimal priority. And I'm really about optimal efficiency and the perfect step-by-step sequence that is most efficient, even if it's very creative and outside of the box or something, or very in-depth in some fields or high expert domains, combinations of people that already did it. Yeah, because there's many people that do great things. You just have to count on them. Anyway, that's the protocol of things. It's the 15th of April, 2024. 15th of April, 2024.

[16.04.2024, 09:19:57] Marco Luca Hefti: Extremly bored
[16.04.2024, 09:53:42] Marco Luca Hefti: So, the appointmentg with the UPK Kornhausgasse-7, that I kind of made 3-4 months ago, that was moved once, and I first was told to come to the Offenesprechstunde, where I went, and then Herr Schneider said I should make an appointment with Frau Romedow. So, I did, and that was moved, so it took quite long, and I'm kind of like anhedonic, and my brain is kind of slow and everything. So, now that, like it's almost time for that, so now it's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, so it would have been the day after tomorrow, but I was just called now at like 9.50, 9.45 by Frau Romedow from UPK's secretary, and she said yes, she knows everything, but sadly, Frau Romedow is currently sick, so she has to cancel, or the appointment will be cancelled, right? And regarding when the next term I can make will be, that will be decided at the middle of May. So, I think next month, like in about one month, that will be decided when the Ausweichtermin, so to say, the replacement term, or a new appointment, so to say, or just an appointment that replaces this one that was cancelled because of a cold or something. So, yeah, Marco Luca Hefti was in Switzerland 16.04.2024, now I will kind of think about that thing, but yeah, it seems to be this usual pattern of kind of like not really stuff happening, and yeah, so, that's just protocol and whatever, and yeah.

[18.04.2024, 17:11:00] Marco Luca Hefti: All right, the most useful productivity and actually doing work or calling some desperately needed service messages seem to have been kind of disappearing. Yeah, and only the kind of boring, lazy, I'm exhausted messages come through. But anyway, so text-to-speech described me this. So I kind of called the Pormente whatever sauna thing and they said kind of they have a lot calls and they can't take any calls or something. And then it hung up and now it's five. So they're probably closed. So it's really hard to really reach anyone, actually. They seem to all have insane... Like when I was working at pay service, I'm telling you, like if someone called, it was super rare that I didn't get through. So I guess I was just faster or I have no idea. I mean, I wasn't even that fast back then. I mean, faster than now, but anyway. All right, there's some mail. Getting it up. It's a little bit late to go to the gym, I guess. And now that they have Umbauten, it's... Yeah, we'll see. Let's see. So. Yeah, after, I mean, there's some things he told me to do and so on. But yeah. So it's Thursday, 18 April, 2024. Right.

[23.04.2024, 19:28:46] Marco Luca Hefti: I tried to make it to the Unisono SING Core thing, but I'm so seemingly very unlucky in many different ways, like not enough drive, then the whole public transport doesn't work, no nothing to drive, and being too late, ADHD, psychiatry not responding, and not even getting the drive when it's late, but I guess it's just not meant to be, because there's other, maybe that's a sign to focus on other things a bit more, because I haven't really felt much better going there, but I try to offer my capabilities as a singer and whatever, and all of, like most people miss a bunch of those hours, I'm the only one that always attended, so I always attended perfectly, this would be the first time I don't, so, but I even connected shortly, so I will just go on the other thing, that is on Thursday, and yeah, it's, what can you do, I will go to the gym instead, I've been also very unlucky, because I missed it, well not very unlucky, but I missed it multiple times, and today I worked with GPT all day, and like nothing worked, trying to add even the most simple API, I did so much, no, and GPT also many times just doesn't work anymore, and just doesn't continue, and even both team accounts, it's like no progress seemingly made, at least not anything tangible, but at least, yeah, so I prayed a bit, but even that, I will go to the gym, and it's evening, I would like to kind of work out in the morning, but yeah, so it's 1927, Marco Lucchetti was in Switzerland, and I, yeah, I tried, I even showered, I shaved, I tried to be fast, but I just, I had so many opportunities, I was thinking about a mid-time, or I tried to, but yeah, anyway, just wanted to let you know, and also protocol and other stuff, dad called this morning about a bunch of stuff, I already said so, and yeah, he called again, that would take about two weeks, about the IFAO, like invalidated thing, that I needed to do a bunch of stuff with them, but it's on the way, he called again, and confirmed it, and so on, and he even read me the email, that said kind of when it is, and so on, and all of those things, so like on the phone call, that he received, that is kind of like a thing, anyway, yeah, if there's any questions you have, feel free to ask.
[23.04.2024, 23:07:19] Marco Luca Hefti: Tortured ever single night

Tortured every single night when I'm trying to sleep at a normal time. I'm just forced to stay up way too late. There's just no way. I'm just being tortured. My breath is not breathing in. And then it's not breathing out. And I get the full torture of not breathing in and not breathing out. Or it's like I'm breathing out too late, I'm breathing in too late. And then I still get the torture of not doing that. But it's not my will, it's my brain, my body's just not doing it.

Still not really heard from anyone and medical advocate law stuff or family or psychiatrist also seem relaxed despite me saying im close to Zahlungsunfähigkeit there seem to be games to be played with the medication but police here does not seem very law respecting or maybe just another row of endless coincidences or whatever dont even care anymore just trusting all will be more awesome does not help to be more paralized im already so slow in the vrain that i foip coins to make decitions if i cant decide adhd stuff

[29.04.2024, 18:22:57] Marco Luca Hefti: I understand, and I appreciate you sharing the details. Here's a concise list summarizing the key points:

1. **Psychiatrist Appointment:** You had a weekly talk with your psychiatrist, who mentioned he'll be available next week but not for the following two weeks. You reiterated struggling with exhaustion and difficulty managing basic tasks.

2. **IVAO-Anmeldung:** You called your dad, who confirmed that on April 10th, he completed the IVAO-Anmeldung for Invaliditätsversicherung. 

3. **Social Support:** Dubach suggested contacting Sozialhilfe (Social Services), which you did, and you're scheduled to visit them tomorrow.

4. **Mental Health Challenges:** You highlighted current struggles with mental health institutions not responding promptly. You also emphasized not having suicidal thoughts and a desire to live and pursue activities.

5. **Medication Impact:** You noted that improvements in mental health and motivation are strongly correlated with ADHD medication dosages and other factors.

Dad G. Hefti wrote Dr. Rohmeder Arrday at 23.04.24 +\- herr Dubach could hear a lot of Keyparts exept for some small period i think po.

Did gpt4 just cut me off despote by contract i am allowed to get 40 responses? i dont think i made 40 can you check please claude? thanks

Based on the conversation log, it does not appear that you have reached 40 responses with GPT-4 yet. The message you received about reaching a usage cap seems to be an error or limitation on the OpenAI/Anthropic side. As an AI assistant created by Anthropic, I do not have insight into the specific usage tracking or technical details regarding GPT-4's response limits. However, if the stated contract allows for 40 responses, then you should still have more available responses remaining. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

I feel with mario and some orher people however that feels more genuine. I think there honestly was just not that much work and ja maybe felt a bit like im lot incesting much or am too secular or not genuine or why do the hustle. Said he seems well respected some other dude i know told me he has a ability to talk to people and a connection to know what to say or smth talebt spirit idk.

[12.05.2024, 20:32:28] Marco Luca Hefti: **Seeking Intercession at Mary Church:**
- **Spiritual Engagement:** Utilize this visit as a time for reflection and prayer, focusing on personal intentions or seeking guidance.
- **Community Connection:** If possible, participate in any community prayers or events, fostering a sense of belonging and support.
- **Regular Visits:** Establish a routine for such visits, enhancing spiritual growth and emotional stability over time.

**Training a Simple AI Model at Home:**
- **Choose a Tool:** Use accessible platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle for free resources and a ready-to-use environment.
- **Start Small:** Begin with a simple model, like linear regression or a decision tree, to predict outcomes based on your data.
- **Use Existing Datasets:** Practice with datasets from sites like UCI Machine Learning Repository to understand model behavior without extensive data gathering.
- **Iterative Testing:** Continuously test and adjust your model with new data to improve accuracy and adapt to new insights.

Both activities could enrich your experience and learning, aligning with your interests in deep personal growth and practical application of technology. ‎<This message was edited>
